Since the Speed Track supply is dwindling on eBay, and I needed a few more of this style of shorts in different colors, I figured I'd give these a try. Sadly, the are even more inferior than I'd anticipated. First, these have only one pocket in the back, as opposed to the three pockets in the Speed Tracks. This means that if you wear these while running, and you need to grab something from your pocket mid-run, you have to break stride to wrestle yourself for access to the Train Times' one back pocked. Speed Tracks allowed you to grab a Gu or gel from the easily accessible side pockets. Second, the legs on these shorts ride up in a way that the Speed Track shorts do not. Both pairs have the same 6"" inseam and a similar fit, so I am mystified as to why these don't stay put. While I can stand tugging at these on a quick training run, I would not want to run a marathon in them. 26.2 miles is too long and too exhausting for having to worry about the state of one's shorts. Speed Tracks, on the other hand, were perfect. Nothing moved, and there were those easily accessible pockets. On the bright side, these are very cute to look at, and as long as you purchase a darker color or a pair of shorts with a pattern, any massive sweating will likely be unnoticeable. On the flip side, you likely won't want to do a whole lot of moving in these because of the aforementioned leg issues. For reference, I am 5'9"" and I weigh about 145 pounds.

I bought it in Vintage Rose and experienced the line that another reviewer has mentioned. I returned it and re-ordered it (after checking daily for a couple weeks for it to be back in stock!). Shows up again, same line down the middle, even worse this time. I don't know what is going on, but it sucks because it's such a great top - but certainly not in the VR color. I wish there were other colors available, particularly in my local store, because it's one of the few tops I like. And frankly it's a pain in the butt to keep having to return and deal with it.

I have other Cool Racerback which I LOVE so I felt inclined to add a new one to my summer collection. It arrived (quick!), I love the color, feels like butter and so smooth and wonderful, but there is this weird line through the middle almost like a defect or something that will compel me to return it, unfortunately. It tugs at my heartstrings, seriously, because I had high hopes and envisioned getting a lot of wear of this wonderfully beautiful vibrant color. Even looking at the online model in the Vintage Rose, you can see the faint line right through the middle of the tank. I just can't keep this, but will quite likely order another in the same color in hopes that it doesn't have the weird line.",,,5,0

The material is buttery soft, with good stretch and the length is a few inches shorter than the original CRBs which I find actually too long. I would also say these fit smaller.

But in Nulu, i’m a fan and i tried one and now one more. What i had not liked in the CRB 2 design was the halter like effect of the straps set closer in to bring up the front (which i wanted too) as opposed to the wider set straps of the original CRB - a comfort not a style issue for me. But the Nulu fabric is so soft i don’t find it constricting on the neck like many of the luon colors and in the two colors i bought - the white and the vintage rose - i find the same fit, whereas the luon option really seemed to vary a lot in fit by color/pattern.

Just when my faith was starting to be restored in this company...,2018-05-31,"I have honestly never been so disappointed in lulu. Some of this could be due to my exceedingly high expectations for this product... I fell in love with the cool racerback around 7 years ago and have been stocking up ever since. It is literally the only tank top I wear. A few months ago I ordered the align pant on a whim, solely due to the color. I was kicking myself for spending so much on a pair of leggings until I put them on...buttery soft perfection. Life changing. Since then I have been stocking up on the aligns as well and praying that they would come out with a cool racerback in the same fabric. And they finally did! HOWEVER, the nulu fabric has completely changed! It is no longer the buttery soft, want to live in forever fabric that I have fallen in love with. It feels like standard material, not at all worth the money and not at all like the previous nulu fabric. It is not just these tanks, I ordered the nulu bra and the align crop and all of them have a much stiffer fabric than previous aligns. Buyer beware!!! If you didn't wear aligns before then you won't know the difference and I am sure you will love this tank but if you have you are going to be extremely disappointed. Honestly, lulu, enough with the sub par fabrics to increase your profit margins. This keeps happening to all of your exceptional products. I am looking to take my business elsewhere.",,,5,0

I don’t know if that’s typical of all the PR skirts without panels or not, but I was sure bummed.

The fabric is swift ultra light, so it's a thin breezy material (again, similar to Hottie hots) but it still feels like quality material, not cheap. The shorts portion is ""laser cut"" so there is no seam at the bottom of them. There are built-in underwear as well. The Jaded color is very pretty and saturated in person.

I wear size 4 in most US brands and size up to 6 in Lululemon. My bra size is 34B. This top is very tight on the chest and very loose on the waist. It looks like a maternity dress on me! Sizing down would not resolve this issue because it would be too tight on my chest.
One feature of this top I really like is the high neck line, which keeps everything in place even when I do headstands, etc. I would be happy if Lululemon made more tops with a high neck line. However, because this top is so loose below the chest it rolls up and reveals my belly in inversions, which is really annoying. If they had made this top tighter on the waist it would have been perfect.",,,1,0

It fits perfectly in the bust - I'm a 32DDD and its snug without feeling like a corset, supportive enough I can run in it, the coverage is great - no side boob, and the higher neck gives peace of mind that I wont be falling out of the top - I can just focus on my work out. The material is so soft and comfortable. The rest of the tank fits beautifully, accenting my waist, and fitting very nicely over my hips. I like the longer length, I dont have to worry about the tank shifting or moving out of place when I'm wearing it.

The bra piece fits perfectly but the body of the tank fits a lot looser than anticipated. It almost flares out into an A line which I was not anticipating.

I confess to habitually ordering the same styles in different colours. I also gravitate towards tanks cut higher at the neckline. Unfortunately, I have struck out on the fit in recent attempts, including this one. The Stash N' Run tank was purchased in my usual bra size (8) but I found it small in the bust and way too long in the length. For reference, I am close to 5'2"", 36B and a muscular 120 lbs. (I run and lift). As with the Slide with Me tank, the bottom hem lands beyond my hips. Unfortunately, the material of Stash N' Run is stiff and the cut creates an unflattering A-line at the fullest part of my hips.

I am a nurse and have to wear my hair up every day. Ponytail holders can be very damaging and also not keep your hair up. This is pretty and functional.

I love the fabric its made out of too! I've worn it every day since I bought it! Keep these coming in all the colors! Would love a white, black, and gray!",,,1,0

The criss cross open back is such a cute feature, the Clear Mint color is beautifully bright, and the fabric is so unique. I love it as both a layering piece and on its own. I'm tall and pretty athletic, so I was worried it was a bit too open in the back, but checking the item photos, it seems it fits just right. BUT, after just one wear to the airport (not even working out in the least bit), I'm seeing fraying along the seam lines. There are threads sticking out everywhere there are seams, and the smooth fabric doesn't look so put together anymore. It seems that the unique fabric has some issues with this thread, and I'm so nervous it's not going to hold up over time if this is it's condition after one wear.","July 31, 2018","Dear KatieO,

The material is very lightweight, so it wicks sweat fast and keeps me cool when I'm running (it's like a very thin Nulux material).
