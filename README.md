# web-scraping-lululemon

- Reviews updated 10/15
- Contains over 1,500 user reviews on men's running clothes from lululemon.com
- Selenium was used to scrape reviews (scrapy could only handle so much when it came to JSONs...AJAX requests were killer.)
- Notebook developing models to predict whether or not a user's review will receive a response from customer care
- Next Steps: 
  - scrape new reviews to predict responses (or not).
  - include more features in model such as user rating, sentiment values, customer demographics (many NA's here so not sure the usefulness)
