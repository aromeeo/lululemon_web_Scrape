I love it because it does it's job and helps roll out sore muscles and I hate it because those same sore muscles are screaming while I do it! This is a great roller because the outer layer gets deep and the inner roller gets even deeper. I do wish you could use the outer portion without the inner portion in it, but it's very easy to slide in and out! The grooves get a deeper stretch into the muscle much better than a flat roller does.

The Metal Vent Tech t-shirts and Polos sold me on the brand. The new version seem to be an attempt to maximize profit by reducing quality. The design seems to have been simplified by removing the back side technical pattern which gave the shirt a more high end appearance and provided better breathability for workout hot spots. They also don't seem to be holding up as well either. They seem to stretch and sag a bit more as well as pilling.

Now the mediums have gotten shorter which would be fine but the large has gotten wider and doesn't stay with lulu's fitted look.

Unfortunately, it soaks up sweat like a sponge... so much so that I've resorted to only wearing it to lighter activity sessions. During more intense exercise, as you sweat, the shirt begins to feel incredibly heavy and sticky. Savasana becomes difficult, as I can't wait to peel myself from the fabric. Additionally, I have to be incredibly delicate while pulling it over my head as it feels like it's about to rip at any moment due to the added weight from the moisture absorption.

I sweat a bit when I'm exercising, but the sweat stains that appeared on this shirt during my first workout in it are impossible to get out and are really really really visibly obvious. I tried every trick I could look up online and two different stain remover products that have worked flawlessly on my white undershirts and dress shirts and every other workout shirt I've owned and I just can't get them out of this one after a single use. I've never had this happen with any other brand and I really don't know what to do, the thing's super comfortable but unwearable unless I can show up to the gym already sweating like a pig to camouflage it I guess.

I do not understand why you have to change things that are not broken. I may have to venture on other brands as there’s no other 4” or 5” shorts you have with the regular liners anymore. An associate suggested purchasing other shorts w/ the liners I want & just have it tailored (as that's free) so it'll be the same length. It's so much of a hassle.

The liner is too tight, too small, and too short. I am a fit yogi with 33"" waist wearing a size large in these shorts (normally wear medium), and the liner is constantly moving and creeping up where it needs to be adjusted constantly and continuously during my yoga practice. I tried wearing them a few times to practice to see if I could get used to them, but it is a losing proposition. One cannot partake in yoga with a liner that will not let you move thru your flow. The luxtreme liner is far superior, never a need to adjust during yoga, with ultimate comfort.
Other issues, the side pocket seems smaller, items do not fit comfortably like previous shorts. Also, pocket on liner is difficult to place phone into, not as secure as previous shorts.

with Lululemon. I’m my opinion, the company has completely crashed and
burned and the only thing of any quality left is the customer service.
I have no idea why they decided to make these short, but they did an
absolutely terrible job. The quality is poor; the cut is terrible and
uncomfortable; the draw string is on the inside not the outside; the
waist band is ineffective and uncomfortable; etc.; etc. The fabric is
decent however, and the color is nice. That’s about it. It seems very
apparent that Lululemon is either not speaking with its customers to
find out what they want, or they are doing like Nike and catering to a
few zealous customers and freezing out the majority. Either way, I may
very well be done with them, I’m tired of returning stuff or having it
fall apart. R.I.P. The Lululemon we all once loved.",,,1,0

The bag is comfortable when secured, it does not bounce, and has many pockets for cell phone, papers and work clothes when making that run/commute back home from work. There is however one problem with the bag --- the bag straps, when worn with a silverscent lululemon shirt, pulls at the silverscent threads leaving a worn down patch of fabric at the upper right and left shoulder blade contact points (three of my shirts have noticeable pilling at the shoulder blade). Other lululemon running shirts (that do not have silverscent) have been left unscathed, nevertheless it is rather disappointing to see the high quality of silverscent shirts compromised by a fellow lululemon product.",,,23,1

He usually wears them without underwear, and has not had any issues with popping out, since they are a good length. They have room to move, without being baggy, and just enough stretch in the material to allow him to get into half pigeon pose with ease. He was worried about pockets getting in the way, but the material is low profile and the pockets have turned out to be convenient. He loves how quickly they dry. I usually hang dry our workout clothes, and I've noticed these shorts dry faster than anything else. They are excellent for wicking away sweat.

They're a great length - not too short and not too long - and they are very lightweight and comfortable. Fit true to size as well. Some other shorts with the elastic waist band tend to run a little small. For reference, I'm 6'1"" with a 33"" waist and go with a L in these.

After having to do laundry every few days to keep my gym clothes from having that funky smell that you can never get rid of I decided to try these Metal Vent Tech products and I was impressed. After a month or so I decided that it was time to look at updating all my gym shirts to products like this and eliminated basically anything cotton from my gym bag. In doing so I went to my local lululemon store and I purchased a number of Metal Vent Tech items including this 1/2 Zip and also a Metal Vent Tech hoodie. I don't really wear these items to workout in like I do the shirts and tanks. So they really shouldn't have much wear on them. Much to my surprise this garment as well as the hoodie are made of what would appear to be a lighter weight fabric than the shirts and tanks. The fact that warmer weather garments are made of a lighter weight fabric seemed a bit baffling to me. However the most troubling thing for me was that after only one wash, both of these garments did not fair well. They showed a lot of wear and had significant pilling. The pills would easily snag or get caught on things and cause small holes or tears in the fabric over time. I might understand this happening if I hadn't taken care in washing the garments. However, I had just purchased a new front loading washer and washed these two garments by themselves in cold water. I attempted to return the items without luck so they sat at the back of my closet until recently when i was going through things and found them. I decided to give them to goodwill and was reminded that I should write a review so that others are cautioned against purchasing this garment, or others that are made from the lighter weight material used here. I made the assumption that all items with the name Metal Vent Tech were made of the same fabric, but clearly they are not. While I have had a great experience with most of the shirts and tanks, this experience makes me cautious as purchasing other Metal Vent Tech products.",27-Oct-17,"Hey GregoryGearGuy,

I've always loved the fabric/feel/stretchiness of all 4 of my surge tanks and have never had a problem with them. I mainly order online for convenience, but the last time I was in the store buying additional items for my wife, I picked up another surge tank and really liked the dark maroon color of a metal vent tank so I bought it as well. This tank feels great and has all the benefits of the surge tank without the extra holes/vents.
Now my bad experience....since I liked the metal vent tank I bought in stores so much, I purchased two more when they were on sale online. I got them in a very dark green/black color and a deep cobalt blue color. Both tanks feel nothing like any of the prior tanks i purchased. The material is very rough on the skin, scratchy/itchy, and almost seems like a harder material that doesn't have as much stretch. Needless to say i'm very disappointed in the purchase of these two as they seem like a whole different tank from a cheaper quality brand. At first I just thought it was the style and lucked out by getting an extra soft one with the maroon tank I first purchased, but after going back into a store and trying on a grey and a white metal vent tank I'm convinced there's a quality assurance issue or somethings wrong with the fabric. I have to be careful pulling/stretching out the tank when it clings to me because it already seems to be pilling and the seams might come undone if i pull too hard (would never happen stretching the surge tank out or my other maroon metal vent tank).
I guess from now on i'll stick to the surge tanks because they feel amazing and haven't let me down so far.",7-Jun-18,"Hi PupFamTXCO,

These are not the same quality as before. I wear these to play basketball and weight lifting, and let me tell you, they are not great quality for those type of exercises. The tanks are supposed to wick off sweat for lightness and breathability but it acts more like a sponge. They absorb all my sweat and weighs it down after 20 minutes of exercise (fyi, I'm not a heady sweater, just normal). The sweat absorption causes you to get very cold if you don't have a spare shirt to change in. It actually caused me to get a mildly sick one time due to how much liquid was on my body and the cold temperature of the gym. Ever since, I either avoid wearing these or bring a spare shirt to change if I'm out of workout clothes (a huge inconvenience in the middle of a workout). I would definitely stay away from these and try a different brand that will do what it is meant to do.

Let me tell you the shirt STINKS before you even wear it, right out of the wash the shirt smells I couldn't even stand the smell through out my work out. It smells like some kind of copper or metal (hence the name). But I don't understand this logic, why make a shirt that is suppose to mitigate POTENTIAL stinkiness coming from sweat and bacteria by creating a product/fabric and inherently stinks to begin with. I was very upset when it made all my other clothes in the wash stink as well. I tried washing it again after the first wash with more detergent and the smell would not go away. I wouldn't recommend buy anything from the metal vent line for this reason. Lululemon shorts are second-to-none, I have dozens of their shorts but this tank is a no no.

I will definitely be purchasing more in the future.",,,0,0

I would buy several. I would even pay extra to get the colors(light heathered grey and light heathered purple) and desperately needed length specially made for me. It's far too wide through the trunk as well. At least 1-3 inches less would be ideal.

This is the first review I have written about any product from LuLu and that coming from someone who who has shopped LuLu for the past 8 years and wears some kind of LuLu clothing almost everyday of my life. Recently bought this shirt in 3 different colors navy, black, and teal. Navy and black shirts fit great as always and are comfortable to wear when working out or as casual. Though old versions of this shirt seem more durable as this shirt is very thin and light...possibly prone to holes as I read from other reviews. The Teal version of this shirt however has a completely different fit then the other two colors. Very tight almost like spandex and I have never worn anything but large shirts from LuLu. Will be returning the teal but keeping the navy and black. Truly hope the quality of LuLu makes a comeback since how durable and comfortable the clothing always has been is why I don’t mind paying a premium for these clothes. As I read reviews all across the board on many of their new products it doesn’t look good right now. Make LuLu Great Again.",,,11,0

However, the shirt has not held up well to regular use. I launder the shirt according to instructions, and do not use the dryer. The neck line has started pilling pretty badly, and a small hole has developed in the fabric at the navel. Not sure how the hole got there, but anything is possible. The pilling though is something I would expect with a cheaper, poorer quality shirt, not necessarily one at this price point, and not after such short use. It is not so bad that I can't use the shirt, but now it looks ratty enough that I can only wear it for exercise and would not wear it to social occasions.

They were truly the comfiest liner this store had ever put out. Unfortunately, with the advent of the OMM liner, the short took a drastic drop. I only ever wear Pace Breakers, and I prefer ones with liner so I don't have to buy underwear to go along with it, but after trying to like the OMM liner I just can't. It is incredibly tight, rides up and gets stuck, and is far too compressive. The reason I preferred the old liner was the relative loose quality, whereas when lululemon used luxtreme as a liner it was unbelievable tight. Hopefully I will be able to go into the store and have the liners removed, however I am disappointed that I lost money because I paid for the liner, and now need to have the liner removed.",1-Aug-18,"Hi smw723,

These are the opposite: more rough, much tighter and less comfortable, and ride up a lot! Sizing up to XL may solve the problem, but I still don't know if I'm going to like the material of the liner, it's rough. I hope the sizing and material gets closer to what the shorts were.

My shirt, in black, fit perfectly the first two wears. I didn't need to wash it, so I wore it a third time. It had lost its shape. It was wider. A bit longer. And the collar started to become lop sided when undone. After my first wash, hoping it would regain its slim shape (in cold water with a soft detergent, and hung to dry) the colour started to fade, and the shape didn't return to its original design. For $88, this shirt is not worth the money, if you're looking for something to last. I was once again disappointed by the quality. Loved the shirt, for a few days only.

However, these are 2 concerns:
1) the sizing seems inconsistent - 2017 models seem to be cut tighter with shorter sleeves. I found out the hard and expensive way. I assumed that the same size from last year would fit so I tore the tags off only to find that the shirt was skin tight. So I had to request an a return (this was an online purchase) but was only able to receive merchandise credit
(which I have yet to receive) and then had to re-purchase in store. The same size purchased in store fit more consistent with other Metal Vents I own.
2) this years Metal Vent doesn't seem as durable. Pulls very easily compared to previous years models.

Recently, several friends enticed to try Lululemon. So I got this running short, which was sold to me at the store as the quintessential Lululemon running short. When I asked for a running short with a zipped pocket, I was told by the store employee that Lululemon doesn't have any (which was misleading since I later found some on this website). So I got this pair of short. I still haven't used it. The lack of zipped pocket is a deal braker for me = no place to put my keys/id. And I am still not 100% confident that the pocket could hold my phone. Gels maybe, but I don't want to risk loosing and/or breaking my phone.

Yes, I own the linerless version, they are nice, as are the shorter lengths, it's just, well, nothing is as good as the original. By now I don't need to explain my excitement when I got my weekly email of new releases and saw my prayers had been answered and my beloved shorts were updated and released! I ordered every color and even in two sizes, just to make sure the fit was right. Well, I eagerly jumped into my fresh shorts for Monday morning practice and only about 20 minutes in I was in agony. The liner of the shorts kept riding up causing a chain reaction that though it's hard to describe here, let's just say that these shorts are ball crushers!I tried everything, pulled liner down over and over, adjusted, tightened and loosened waistband, nothing worked. Frustrated, I went home and examined the shorts to try and identify the source of my, um, discomfort. Don't know what it is exactly, but the liner just doesn't have the appropriate shape/pouch for, well, you know.

Many of my bottles have now warped, either being completely unable for use, or causing major leakage. I am out on the water for 1-2 hours almost every day, and no matter how much ice i use, the water in my bottle is always warm before 2 hours of being outside with it.

Great lightweight material, good length, no liner, side pockets and a side-back zippered pocket - overall exactly the versatile workout shorts I needed. Recently purchased 4 more pairs online and all of them came with a waistband that doesn't stretch making the shorts impossible to put on. They fit perfectly once you practically rip the waistband apart trying to squeeze them around the wider thigh/butt region to get them up to your waist. Seems to be a flaw in the new design with the drawstring not being long enough to allow a stretch in the waistband. Thought this was just an issue with the batch I ordered online, so I took them back to the store and tried some on there. Same issue with all of them. Going up a size doesn't help because the waist is too big on size L (but those also have the same issue of not being able to stretch the waistband).

Lululemon does not provide repairs to inner liners anymore, which is very disappointing seeing how the quality of the liners has been extremely poor for years now and I am sure they know seeing the plethora of feedback on such. At the very least, provide liners at cheap cost for replacement. I would've been ok with that but we are forced to spend >$68 for new pairs now.

I totally get that on average, most men prefer plain and basic colors and patterns, but some, like me, have a preference for the creative looks.

As a matter of fact, I've been asked not to spend the money on lulu shorts anymore.

They are lightweight and breathable. I am a heavy sweater and the moisture wicking ability of these shorts is perfect. They maintain their light and breathable feel even when soaked in sweat. Normally I do not like shorts with those backward zipper pockets, but this pair of shorts has that as an extra pocket rather than the only pocket. That allows me to secure something if I need it secured during periods of high movement, (ID, Keys, Credit Card) or if I am not worried about any of those things falling out (during periods of low movement) then I can keep my items in the regular pockets where they are easier to access. The shorts slide on and off easily, but maintain their grip on my hips when I am sweaty and performing rigorous exercise. That has been an issue with several pairs of shorts in the past where after getting sweaty, the shorts become so heavy that they fall down, or I would have to secure them so strictly with a tie string that it becomes a hassle. The waistband of these holds up without any extra worry from me. I highly recommend these shorts for anyone who sweats as much as I do (and I am in a humid environment so the sweat doesn't leave).",,,0,0

Some great (I have chased a pair of pants to a store 3 states away), some disappoint; but this thing is absolutely horrible. I used it for a run when the weather finally got warmer. I was looking forward to this warm spring run. This thing destroyed the run. It annoyed me to the ends of the earth. Its like it is engineering from the ground up to annoy its unfortunate wearer. I will give it this, the garment is light weight and fabric feels kinda cool, but yet the hood weighs about the times as much as the rest of it so its awkward. The hood drags the garment up you in a weird way and it feels heavy on your back and generally uncomfortable. The collar and zippers are engineered in such a manner that ensures either side is always in the perfect position to drag the zipper clear across your neck. They even reinforced the edges of the to make absolutely certain there is weight to drag this thing uncomfortably on any part of your sweaty neck it can. My neck is raw from the zipper dragging on my run. If this was the only thing I owned from Lululemon, I would probably never return. Its that awful. Blew $100 on something I am never....

There's nothing like living life with clothes that squeeze you into feeling like you're still in your mother's womb. Anyway, about the headband. It has always been my dream to have a man bun, but let me tell you, it has been one awkward journey. I have this medium length hair that's too short to be tied and too long to be quaffed backed, I look like one of those trolls dolls. Hence the use of headbands. I've been using bandana's but they get drenched in sweat and I wanted to treat myself, as a way of self-congratulating for being one step closer to my dream. So I purchased this lululemon headband. At first it fit fine, sure it was a tad loose. But as I workout and get down and dirty, the headband seems to shift a bit. My hair gathers it's strength and decides to unleash itself and the headband slips right off. I wonder if my head is just a weird shape or if my hair is truly that powerful. I like the product, but it just doesnt fit well. Maybe on your own man bun journey this may be a great addition. But sadly my sweaty bandanas that are significantly cheaper work better for me.",23-Jul-18,"Hi PowerHair,

My favorite thing about the short is the amount of support they have in the front. It's not constrictive at but keeps everything in place at any pace.

I'm assuming the fabric for the inaccessible fly is just for looks, for those that feel conscientious wearing running shorts in public places after a run...not me. My two biggest rubs with the shorts is 1) the overall cut of the shorts and 2) the liner width. The cut is a shade on the snug side, given the 3'' length. This could be easily remedied by going to a split design, 1.5 or 2'' in length, or just decreasing the overall length to 2.5'' length.

I wasn't too disappointed as the sizing chart said I would be the larger size; so, exchanged that pair in the store for a L/XL. After trying on those, they were way too big, and would either have to be pulled up so high that they looked goofy, and the heel would be out of place, or they would be bunched up under the middle of my foot.

After the second time washing it however (in a washer I have washed all of my lulu clothing in) I noticed extreme pitting and decrease in the fabric. The material seemed to deteriorate exceptionally fast. What made it even worse is that I called a month and a half after this issue in regards to the return policy and was told no returns after the first month.

However, when I tried them on recently, I believe that article on GQ to be true! Since I only use my lulus for working out since I don't believe in using gym clothes as casual wear to go run errands, restaurant, mall etc., I'd say this henley is good enough to be as a casual outfit matched with a dark and nice jeans.

First of all, these are a good length for regular training, I run about 35-45 mpw and these are a cooler design (temperature wise). Now the bad news. The placement of the pocket is on the side, so if you place your keys in the key pocket, it is constantly rubbing during a run. Nike and most other manufacturers place this on the backside so there's no rubbing. First problem is that you feel the key the entire run. Secondly, this wears through the material. The liner is also not the most comfortable out there.
For the money, you can get 2-3 pairs of Nike or UA shorts for the same price and probably 70% of the comfort with more longevity. Sad, as I really wanted to like these shorts.",,,0,0

1. They do not wick perspiration away. Rather, they suck up and retain all your sweat. You would be dryer getting out of a pool.
2. The pocket is way too small it is virtually useless and the zipper is not the best functioning one.
3. The drawstring, if you can call it that, does not do what it is intended to do, i.e. to tighten your shorts. The design that they use is flawed.
4. The ""shirt holder"" strap in the back of the shorts fails. If your shirt is soaked, it almost pulls your shorts down. If your shirt is dry, the bouncing from running will cause your shirt to eventually fall out.

Initial thoughts: great fit, comfortable, super light, and looked great. I had high expectations of Lululemon, based off other customers holding them in high regard and the high price point. I'm an avid gym goer. Expectations were met until the first time I was them. Keep in mind, I wash everything on a gentle cycle with warm water. I've never ruined any of my clothes. After I washed both shorts I knew there was an issue. The bottom third of the shorts were stretched and were permanently wrinkled. I tried to steam the wrinkles out with no luck. Both shorts exhibited this. Now the shorts are stretched and look disgusting with the permanent wrinkles (almost look like ruffles). I attribute this to the thin fabric not being able to hold it's formed integrity. Needless to say, I wasted $140 on two pairs of shorts that don't fit well and embarrassing to wear. I expected much more from my first pieces of Lululemon clothing. The closest B&M store is 2 hours away so I didn't have a chance to try to return them.

They stretch and bend in every way possible, they're light and roomy, they dry quickly and they don't ride up your leg when doing inversions. Great yoga shorts in my opinion. The only issue I've had, is that they develop a stink after a while if you don't wash or rinse them immediately. I now bring them in the shower with me and rinse with cold water after a session. The stink becomes difficult to wash out and comes back very quickly as with most synthetics.

They're a great length - not too short and not too long - and they are very lightweight and comfortable. Fit true to size as well. Some other shorts with the elastic waist band tend to run a little small. For reference, I'm 6'1"" with a 33"" waist and go with a L in these.

It is incredibly tight, rides up and gets stuck, and is far too compressive. The reason I preferred the old liner was the relative loose quality, whereas when lululemon used luxtreme as a liner it was unbelievable tight.

Best shorts I've owned of that type (casual athletic). When the warm weather arrived I went back to to purchase more. I'm a 34"" waist and my first pair fit me PERFECTLY in a L. The liner on the ""updated"" Pacebreakers is extremely small and uncomfortable. It does not match the size of the short. If I size up to XL for the liner to fit, the shorts themselves are too big. Unfortunately, I realized this after purchasing two pair because the salesperson told me that they would stretch (they don't). I won't buy any more of these and can't recommend them to others. I can't imagine how they would fit anyone given the size of the liner relative to the size of the shorts. If it isn't broken, LL, don't fix it.

As shorts that are made for athletes, it doesn't make sense that they would make the liner too tight around my thighs for comfort.

It now comes in the 4”, 6”, but w/ the OOM liners. Some may enjoy the new updated surge shorts but I am not a big fan. This just gets in the way during my bikram classes. I do not understand why you have to change things that are not broken. I may have to venture on other brands as there’s no other 4” or 5” shorts you have with the regular liners anymore. An associate suggested purchasing other shorts w/ the liners I want & just have it tailored (as that's free) so it'll be the same length. It's so much of a hassle.

This is the first review I have written about any product from LuLu and that coming from someone who who has shopped LuLu for the past 8 years and wears some kind of LuLu clothing almost everyday of my life. Recently bought this shirt in 3 different colors navy, black, and teal. Navy and black shirts fit great as always and are comfortable to wear when working out or as casual. Though old versions of this shirt seem more durable as this shirt is very thin and light...possibly prone to holes as I read from other reviews. The Teal version of this shirt however has a completely different fit then the other two colors. Very tight almost like spandex and I have never worn anything but large shirts from LuLu. Will be returning the teal but keeping the navy and black. Truly hope the quality of LuLu makes a comeback since how durable and comfortable the clothing always has been is why I don’t mind paying a premium for these clothes.

The neck line has started pilling pretty badly, and a small hole has developed in the fabric at the navel. Not sure how the hole got there, but anything is possible. The pilling though is something I would expect with a cheaper, poorer quality shirt, not necessarily one at this price point, and not after such short use.

At first I thought it was a lot of money (over $120) for a pair of shorts and shirt but I figured if it kept me comfortable and semi-dry during a workout it would be worth it. After doing a Baptiste yoga class with my new lululemon gear I was very upset with how the clothes performed. I do admit the shorts worked out pretty nicely and were almost completely dry like I would have expected after the class ended. The ($64) shirt was awful. Not only was I soaked after the workout (it did not keep my cool during yoga) I had to hang around the yoga studio for a party afterwards with some of the yogis outside. It was a brisk night when I walked outside and for over an hour the shirt just would not dry. I was freezing! For the price we pay for your clothes I expect quality. I have clothes from Old Navy that are a fraction of the price that performed better than this.

The liner is too tight, too small, and too short. I am a fit yogi with 33"" waist wearing a size large in these shorts (normally wear medium), and the liner is constantly moving and creeping up where it needs to be adjusted constantly and continuously during my yoga practice. I tried wearing them a few times to practice to see if I could get used to them, but it is a losing proposition. One cannot partake in yoga with a liner that will not let you move thru your flow. The luxtreme liner is far superior, never a need to adjust during yoga, with ultimate comfort.
Other issues, the side pocket seems smaller, items do not fit comfortably like previous shorts. Also, pocket on liner is difficult to place phone into, not as secure as previous shorts.

I'm a former collegiate soccer player who continues to run and stay active. I'm 5' 11'' and I'd say I'm in about the same shape I was in college almost 10 years ago. All the previous shorts I've purchased from lululemon had the LUXTREME liner, which I LOVED! However, this new liner, OOM (Out Of Mind) I am NOT a fan of. The convenience of having a built-in-liner is so that you can just grab your shorts and get going. But this liner is made of mostly mesh, it rides up my legs, and is NOT comfortable for all the athletic activities that I perform. Lululemon does offer a T.H.E. Short with a luxtreme liner, but they are all sold out. I wonder why...Anyhow, I wouldn't recommend the newly updated shorts, and I'm hoping I can return these ones.",8-Jun-18,"Dear NateGr,

This couldn't be further from the truth - the liner is more of a mesh liner instead of the compression tight that was previously used. The new mesh liner doesn't stay in place and rides up to the point of being extremely uncomfortable. If you're used to and loved the Luxtreme Liner as much as I do, do NOT buy these.

Run a least marathon a year, (qualified for Boston). I have been using running shorts from other brands for many years and have been very happy with them. Recently, several friends enticed to try Lululemon. So I got this running short, which was sold to me at the store as the quintessential Lululemon running short. When I asked for a running short with a zipped pocket, I was told by the store employee that Lululemon doesn't have any (which was misleading since I later found some on this website). So I got this pair of short. I still haven't used it. The lack of zipped pocket is a deal braker for me = no place to put my keys/id. And I am still not 100% confident that the pocket could hold my phone. Gels maybe, but I don't want to risk loosing and/or breaking my phone. I could still see myself using this short to go to the gym or run on a treadmill but certainly not for outdoor activities.

I am an original Surge Short devotee, I own more than a dozen pairs. Absolutely the best shorts Lulu has ever made. Loved the pocket, the elastic waistband loop is amazing for inversions in practice as well as for hot runs and the fabric has held up over time, so well in fact that many pairs I own look brand new even after 100s of washes. Now, all of that said, I have been very patiently waiting for the release of these shorts. Yes, I own the linerless version, they are nice, as are the shorter lengths, it's just, well, nothing is as good as the original. By now I don't need to explain my excitement when I got my weekly email of new releases and saw my prayers had been answered and my beloved shorts were updated and released! I ordered every color and even in two sizes, just to make sure the fit was right. Well, I eagerly jumped into my fresh shorts for Monday morning practice and only about 20 minutes in I was in agony. The liner of the shorts kept riding up causing a chain reaction that though it's hard to describe here, let's just say that these shorts are ball crushers!I tried everything, pulled liner down over and over, adjusted, tightened and loosened waistband, nothing worked. Frustrated, I went home and examined the shorts to try and identify the source of my, um, discomfort. Don't know what it is exactly, but the liner just doesn't have the appropriate shape/pouch for, well, you know. I have never really experienced this issue and certainly not in the nearly 100 pairs of Lulu bottoms (shorts, trainers, briefs, pants, joggers, Etc).

Metal Vent Tech Short Sleeve,68,2.7 out of 5,2 out of 5,ECLELAND,"DALLAS, TX, USA",SWEATY GENERALIST,45-54,ATHLETIC,,,,Deteriorating quality,7/20/17,I've been a high volume consumer of Lulu clothing for a few years now. The Metal Vent Tech t-shirts and Polos sold me on the brand. The new version seem to be an attempt to maximize profit by reducing quality. The design seems to have been simplified by removing the back side technical pattern which gave the shirt a more high end appearance and provided better breathability for workout hot spots. They also don't seem to be holding up as well either. They seem to stretch and sag a bit more as well as pilling. I sincerely hope Lulu chooses to drive loyalty and repeat sales by improving quality rather than pursue short sighted cost cutting to raise margins. I have always loved them for the innovative high quality materials and construction so please don't change that.,20-Jul-17,"Hey ecleland,

1) the sizing seems inconsistent - 2017 models seem to be cut tighter with shorter sleeves. I found out the hard and expensive way. I assumed that the same size from last year would fit so I tore the tags off only to find that the shirt was skin tight. So I had to request an a return (this was an online purchase) but was only able to receive merchandise credit
(which I have yet to receive) and then had to re-purchase in store. The same size purchased in store fit more consistent with other Metal Vents I own.
2) this years Metal Vent doesn't seem as durable. Pulls very easily compared to previous years models.
Time will tell how well this years Henley holds up but I like the colors offered this season.",,,1,1

I was looking for a light weight shirt that feels comfortable and thought I had found the jackpot. It is a pretty simple looking t-shirt that had gone on sale, so I went ahead and purchased it. I didn't think to check out ALL the pictures of the shirt online before purchasing, specifically in the pewter blue color, where you can see how the shirt actually bunches a little funny around the collar bone as well as around the arm pit area in the back. No matter how you adjust the shirt, it doesn't seem to fit right because of the way the shirt is cut. It is even worse when you raise your arm out or up. You can't see it in the photos, but the distance between the sleeve and the arm pit area is very short. When you lift your arm, you lift the entire shirt and even more fabric bunches up on top of the shoulders. Unfortunately, I can't return the shirt since it was on sale. It was really disappointing, and I would not recommend anyone buy this shirt unless you're into the look of fabric bunching up to form weird looking bumps when you wear a t-shirt.",4-Jul-18,"Hey daytimeshopper,

Some great (I have chased a pair of pants to a store 3 states away), some disappoint; but this thing is absolutely horrible. I used it for a run when the weather finally got warmer. I was looking forward to this warm spring run. This thing destroyed the run. It annoyed me to the ends of the earth. Its like it is engineering from the ground up to annoy its unfortunate wearer. I will give it this, the garment is light weight and fabric feels kinda cool, but yet the hood weighs about the times as much as the rest of it so its awkward. The hood drags the garment up you in a weird way and it feels heavy on your back and generally uncomfortable. The collar and zippers are engineered in such a manner that ensures either side is always in the perfect position to drag the zipper clear across your neck. They even reinforced the edges of the to make absolutely certain there is weight to drag this thing uncomfortably on any part of your sweaty neck it can. My neck is raw from the zipper dragging on my run. If this was the only thing I owned from Lululemon, I would probably never return. Its that awful. Blew $100 on something I am never....

If you're going for a light jog, you'll probably be fine, but if you do anything more, I'd buy something else. Once you start to sweat, the shirt immediately begins to stick to your body. As you continue to sweat, the shirt gets more and more wet and suctions itself to you. On top of that, it takes forever to dry. I've hung it up and left it for 12 hours, expecting it to by dry, only to find that it was still very damp. Spend your money on something else.",2-May-18,"Hey DannyH,

I did some research, and thought this would be a great first piece for him, especially being on mark down. In store I found the grey color. He tried it on, and loved it. He said it was very comfortable, and liked the looser fit. He is also a generally sweaty guy, so having the anti-stink technology is really helpful. He loves this shirt so much that he wears it almost everywhere; to class, working out, walking the dogs, hanging around the house, running errands etc. It is the perfect shirt for spring, summer, and fall. Winter it won't be warm enough here, but I think it would be a good layering piece. The reason that I like this shirt is because it's very flattering on my husband. Specifically the stitching on the upper neck-area of the shirt. Finding a shirt that not only feels good physically, but makes him feel good mentally is a win-win.

I have read how fragile the fabric is, so I am always worried I will put a hole in it just from wrestling it on.
I got the women's 2 sizes too big just for the arms to be comfortable. However, the body of the shirt makes me look like a lego guy, round and shapeless, but at least I can put my arms in it without too much of a fight.
I got this shirt because we go mining, and I needed something breathable, easy to take on and off, long sleeved to protect my arms from sun and scrapes, and stink free.
I wore it mining yesterday and I was very comfortable. I could push the sleeves up when I needed to (which I cannot do in the women's), easily put them back down, quickly put my thumbs in the thumbholes and put my gloves back on without a second thought, it was oversized enough that I never felt like my shirt was pulling or I had to adjust it while I'm on the side of a mountain.
As a bonus, when we got off the mountain and were eating dinner at the base, the cooler breeze started to pick up and I was still comfortable.
I like the colors of the women's swiftly, and I will wear it around town, however for function and working, this is the shirt I will be wearing. I only wish men's came in something besides black and grey! Don't men like some color too? I want to be seen when I'm on the side of the hill, not blend in!

It is perfect it every way but I wish it came in an all black version like the regular metal vent techs. I like this more than the regular ones but the color is a little flashy for everyday wear and looks like an UA pattern.
Also, word on sizing, I ordered a medium Metal Vent Tech on sale from the website and it fit like a large in this shirt from the store. Glad I bought it in store or I would have had to exchange it.",,,0,0

Ridiculous that a shirt of this 'material' and price is already losing its shape while my target shirts retain shape after 3 years.

While I enjoy lounging around my house on Saturdays in my non-wool metal tech, the wooly metal tech is an improved shirt for winter activities. The wool adds just a bit of heat but not so much to be uncomfortable. I liked it so much, I bought a second so I could rest shirts in between ski days. Also great for days when the house can't seem to get warmed up.",,,0,0

The fabric is soft and seems as though it would be warmer than the standard metal vent tech shirts, but I haven't been able to wear it because the sizing is quite small. I (incorrectly) assumed it would fit similarly to the regular metal vent tech shirts, but it's much tighter than I expected. I want to love this shirt, but it's too tight to be comfortable. Thus, I'm forced to return it. ... otherwise, if the sizing were correct, I'd happily give it a five-star review.",,,0,0
