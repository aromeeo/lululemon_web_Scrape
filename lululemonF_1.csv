Tried on the 10 and it was perfect. I worked out in it twice already and it really has held up..

LET'S GO FOR IT! I've been waiting for a bra like this for awhile now.
As I received it, I tried and it was all true, lock and loaded. I was excited to tried for a workout. I'm a DD and my ribcage is very small, it's hard to find something that fits right so I was super excited when I saw how great this bra hugged me.
Today I finally had a chance to take it to a real try and I was so disappointed.
After the first 15 minutes, I started felling high pressure on my neck, insane pressure, I wanted to get it off immediately but I was driving and I was hoping for this sensation to at least get less...pressuring during the workout. I was wrong. It only got worst so one hour later all I could think of was ""I want to get this off right now.""
During the workout, beside the pain on my neck, everything seemed to be just perfect: I jumped and the girls were not moving, I moved around and all good. Went in dower facing dog and did a reach backs and... ALERT ALERT!!! THE GIRLS ARE COMING OUT!!! YES! As this bra is my perfect fit, it doesn't cover the higher part so when you go ""upside down"" they come out!! I was so embarrassed. No one seemed to noticed what I was going through but my workout was a full struggle having to make sure the girls didn't just show off unrequested. Not fun.
I don't know what I'm gonna do with this bra now. There are too many negative things for me to keep using it, also, I noticed that it's really hard to find bras with high support lately here (tons of choices if you have smaller breasts but not enough if you're bigger) so I was really hoping for this to be the one.",,,1,0

I've been eyeing it for a while. I bought it in 2 colors and I really thought it would be the perfect bra. I loved the fact that lulu finally decided to do molded cups because no one really wants a uni boob. It is so hard to find a bra that separates and shapes AND supports you during all activities. I'm no stranger to owning several types of bras and leggings for different sports or activities, but wouldn't it be great if there was one bra that could do all and tick off all my needs. I know it is a tall order and a lot to ask. I mean women's bodies are all so different what works for me won't work for you necessarily. With all that said this bra was a total fail for me and let me tell you why. First off I'm usually a size 6 in lulu tops and bras. 36C 34C depending on the bra. I'm petite and have an athletic build and I feel that's important to mention because bra straps tend to be too long for me. I'm in between sizes 6 sometimes is too tight right but going up to an 8 makes it too big. This bra if you look at the photo's has a binding that goes around all the edges. This is an open invitation for back fat or arm pit fat to spill over. The only way to avoid this is by hoping this bra offers a perfect fit and because I am petite and the straps always tend to be too long if I go up in size defeating the purpose of offering support. The binding also is very uncomfortable and offers very little give or stretch making this bra really hard to put on and take off especially if you are sweaty. If you look at the enlite bra there is no binding making that bra seamless under clothing and more comfortable. I also should add that I have wide athletic breast not full breasts so they don't completely fill the cups. This has always been a problem for me as the width of my breast tissue measures a C-D cup but I don't have the fullness of a C-D cup. The struggle to find a perfect sports bra rages on and because I bought it on sale I have to keep it. Seriously though lulu rethink your WMTM return policy. With tags still on and a shorter return time frame or even for an exchange for other product I think you guys should be a little more accommodating. I know I'm not the only one that has been a long time lulu shopper.","July 31, 2018","Dear skinnylittlefatgirl,

The gap is so big it causes the girls to move around a bit during cardio or high-impact workouts. Because there is no way to adjust the bra - if you're like me and fall into this in-between size (too big for a 6, but too small for an 8) you may find this bra isn't quite right.

I am a 36DD and had issues with my old sports bras not having enough support for my girls, and I finally decided to splurge and get one for a steeper price with hopes that it would work better.
Overall, I like this bra. It works well for weight training and biking. I'm not a runner so I can't speak much to that, but on the bike it works great! The rib band it very snug and holds its place so well, sometimes its a bit tricky to get off. Even though the bands are not adjustable they fit my size well, and I have larger shoulders from years of swimming. The padded shoulders are wonderful also.
The fact that it doesn't have annoying inserts is a godsend! The one issue I do experience with this bra is that while it is made for C/D, for DD I find that I am being pushed up top and it creates this small extra layer of boob at the top, if you get what I mean. It's not too bad, I just find myself shoving my boobs back into the bra a few times during my workout so it's not as obvious.

In the winter its fine to have all the hooks and clasps and usual over the shoulder straps, but in the summer want a low profile bra that looks normal under tank tops or on its own. Problem is that those usually give no support or just mash your boobs together into one blob. This bra is almost perfect! The molded cups without inserts, the comfortable straps, tight rib band, minimalist strap design, ALL PERFECT. I especially love the high cut arm holes, too often racerback bras have these low cut arm holes that then pull towards your neck...hello arm pit fat squeezing out and making you look ridiculous. Some people have complained about this, and every body is different, but I love it. Perhaps that is a petite size thing, I usually end up having straps altered to shorten them and bring the bra up. Only thing I would change about this bra is the slightly low cut front. It isn't terrible, but Im not a fan of having any cleavage when I am trying to workout. Why do they always feel the need for that v in the front? Doing dubs, burpees and handstand pushups, I want the girls to stay out of sight. Even a piece of mesh across the top would suffice. When you have boobs this thing doesn't lay flat across your chest plate, its pulled out and I can see all the way down into the depths of my boobs, not necessary. Its like the classic vneck t-shirt, girls with smaller chests can wear them to work and its fine.

I could have gotten past that though and purchased it except the sides of the bra came up too high and cut into my underarm, it was very uncomfortable because the fabric is very firm and limited my mobility. Now on to the good, my favorite part was the padding , it was permanent (as in no removable cups, yay!) and didn’t give me uniboob, and it was just the right amount, I don’t need a push-up bra to workout, I just need support which this bra gave.

Also, I hate pants and sweat like a wildebeest. Review: Normally I am a tracker short type of girl, but the new tracker V's just don't fit me right, so I veered over to this short and was thrilled with the longer length. They make my butt look amazing and got tons of compliments on the teal color. The leg opening is much more narrow than the trackers, but is very slimming (wear an 8-10 in trackers depending on how loose I want my shorts that day. I purchased a 10 in these shorts and I could NOT have fit into an 8). My issue with these shorts is that they made me look like I peed myself.
It showed just how much crotch and butt sweat occurs when exercising in 90 degree heat. Could anything make you feel more gross than looking at your crotch and wondering if you actually did pee yourself because surely these shorts wouldn't show THAT much sweat.....(after much deliberation, I decided I did NOT pee myself :)). If I buy more of these shorts, I would 100% stick with black because they are very flattering, but then again - I love brightly colored bottoms! Maybe LULU can find a fabric that shows less sweat?","July 20, 2018","Hi CJandNoah,

That being said, there are much more color options for the standard length speed shorts than the longer ones. I would love more of a variety of colors. I have not had any issues with these shorts so far today, and I am looking forward to adding a few of these to my collection, alongside run times. Please Lululemon fix the poking waistband in the hotty hot/tracker shorts, so that I can add them too!",,,4,1
