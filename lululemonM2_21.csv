1) the sizing seems inconsistent - 2017 models seem to be cut tighter with shorter sleeves. I found out the hard and expensive way. I assumed that the same size from last year would fit so I tore the tags off only to find that the shirt was skin tight. So I had to request an a return (this was an online purchase) but was only able to receive merchandise credit
(which I have yet to receive) and then had to re-purchase in store. The same size purchased in store fit more consistent with other Metal Vents I own.

The liner of the shorts kept riding up causing a chain reaction that though it's hard to describe here, let's just say that these shorts are ball crushers!I tried everything, pulled liner down over and over, adjusted, tightened and loosened waistband, nothing worked. Frustrated, I went home and examined the shorts to try and identify the source of my, um, discomfort.

They fit perfectly once you practically rip the waistband apart trying to squeeze them around the wider thigh/butt region to get them up to your waist. Seems to be a flaw in the new design with the drawstring not being long enough to allow a stretch in the waistband. Thought this was just an issue with the batch I ordered online, so I took them back to the store and tried some on there. Same issue with all of them. Going up a size doesn't help because the waist is too big on size L (but those also have the same issue of not being able to stretch the waistband).

Lululemon does not provide repairs to inner liners anymore, which is very disappointing seeing how the quality of the liners has been extremely poor for years now and I am sure they know seeing the plethora of feedback on such.

White and Black have mostly been my go-to's, but it seems like the women's shorts have the best patterns and colors. I totally get that on average, most men prefer plain and basic colors and patterns, but some, like me, have a preference for the creative looks.

The same trip, I purchased a new shirt that too developed a snag in it the first day I wore it (not as noticeable though).

They are lightweight and breathable. I am a heavy sweater and the moisture wicking ability of these shorts is perfect. They maintain their light and breathable feel even when soaked in sweat.

That allows me to secure something if I need it secured during periods of high movement, (ID, Keys, Credit Card) or if I am not worried about any of those things falling out (during periods of low movement) then I can keep my items in the regular pockets where they are easier to access. The shorts slide on and off easily, but maintain their grip on my hips when I am sweaty and performing rigorous exercise. That has been an issue with several pairs of shorts in the past where after getting sweaty, the shorts become so heavy that they fall down, or I would have to secure them so strictly with a tie string that it becomes a hassle.

I will give it this, the garment is light weight and fabric feels kinda cool, but yet the hood weighs about the times as much as the rest of it so its awkward. The hood drags the garment up you in a weird way and it feels heavy on your back and generally uncomfortable. The collar and zippers are engineered in such a manner that ensures either side is always in the perfect position to drag the zipper clear across your neck. They even reinforced the edges of the to make absolutely certain there is weight to drag this thing uncomfortably on any part of your sweaty neck it can.

There's nothing like living life with clothes that squeeze you into feeling like you're still in your mother's womb. Anyway, about the headband. It has always been my dream to have a man bun, but let me tell you, it has been one awkward journey. I have this medium length hair that's too short to be tied and too long to be quaffed backed, I look like one of those trolls dolls. Hence the use of headbands. I've been using bandana's but they get drenched in sweat and I wanted to treat myself, as a way of self-congratulating for being one step closer to my dream. So I purchased this lululemon headband. At first it fit fine, sure it was a tad loose. But as I workout and get down and dirty, the headband seems to shift a bit. My hair gathers it's strength and decides to unleash itself and the headband slips right off. I wonder if my head is just a weird shape or if my hair is truly that powerful. I like the product, but it just doesnt fit well. Maybe on your own man bun journey this may be a great addition.

I'm on the site currently to order a second pair of 3 inch. They fit very well and are very comfortable. I am a marathoner and these shorts can handle speed work and long runs like it's nothing. My favorite thing about the short is the amount of support they have in the front. It's not constrictive at but keeps everything in place at any pace. Most shorts I try on I feel like I put them on backward because of the complete lack of support. Thanks lululemon you nail it on this one. Read the other features of the shorts as there are many.

I haven't utilized the band to tuck the shirt in, which I guess is a nice concept or one could just ditch the shirt in the first place. I'm assuming the fabric for the inaccessible fly is just for looks, for those that feel conscientious wearing running shorts in public places after a run...not me. My two biggest rubs with the shorts is 1) the overall cut of the shorts and 2) the liner width. The cut is a shade on the snug side, given the 3'' length. This could be easily remedied by going to a split design, 1.5 or 2'' in length, or just decreasing the overall length to 2.5'' length. The liner is where Lulu needs to make some serious modifications, however. The liner is way too narrow, it feels like wearing a banana hammock.

I am a size 10.5 in shoes, which according to the website sizing chart, makes me a L/XL in socks. By the look of the socks in the store, the L/XL appeared too big, so I went with a M/L. After trying these on, I returned them as they were too tight in the toes. I wasn't too disappointed as the sizing chart said I would be the larger size; so, exchanged that pair in the store for a L/XL. After trying on those, they were way too big, and would either have to be pulled up so high that they looked goofy, and the heel would be out of place, or they would be bunched up under the middle of my foot. Neither of those options seemed appealing, so I returned those as well. I even tried other styles of socks from Lululemon, and had the same sizing problem. I was disappointed that I could not find a size that worked for me as the socks were very soft and looked to be of high quality.","October 12, 2017","Hi jmd13818,

After the second time washing it however (in a washer I have washed all of my lulu clothing in) I noticed extreme pitting and decrease in the fabric. The material seemed to deteriorate exceptionally fast. What made it even worse is that I called a month and a half after this issue in regards to the return policy and was told no returns after the first month. I have had absolutely no other issues with any article of clothing, so I continue to wear the other articles and ended up donating this one.

It has great technology and built to last. The only problem is that it doesn't last. The shirt had a hole in it after one casual day of wear. Now I have to drive back an hour to Lululemon and go through a whole return process. This is my last straw with Lululemon and can honestly say I will never buy a product from them again. I hope everybody enjoys their snags!,"August 18, 2014","Hi JakeMiz,
I'm sorry to hear about this, and definitely understand your frustration. To create tops that are made to knock out odour, delicate fabrics are used. Know that we stand behind the quality of our gear, and if issues come up, we'll take it back. I know that driving to a far away store is not always convenient, so you can always give us a ring so we can take it back. 1.877.263.9330",4,1

Great for working out, biking, or anything else. The colour options are really nice too, heathered silver spoon especially, which I haven't seen before in the other metal vent tech styles.",,,4,1
