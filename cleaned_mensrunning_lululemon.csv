Last month, I bought the same outfit, size but noticed it said “updated” I the title description.

I’m 6’1” 182lbs and the previous design of the shirt and shorts fit so well I wear them as lifestyle gear, not just to the gym. The “updated” version is so tight I would have to lose 20 lbs to reasonably fit in it. The liner in the shorts is smaller and much tighter than the previous generation (and very uncomfortable). I returned both items to the store and asked if the had any of the old gear for sale (they were sold out). I hope my original purchase of metal vent shirts and 9” lined pace breaker shorts last a long time. I won’t be make any new purchases until the “updated” version goes back to the 2017 version.

Now, they gap open (making the shorts look too tight, which they are not) and are so wide that an iPhone 8 slides to its side, making it very hard to take it out of your pocket. It remained vertical in the old shorts (because the pocket was too narrow for it to turn to its side).

First, the design of the hand pockets changed from a well-fit and well-cut vertical arrangement that kept the outer fabric of the pocket close to the shorts, to a diagonal, loose arrangement that causes the outer pocket to curve away from the shorts, creating a large, goofy arc.

These new liners are complete garbage. They took everything that was great about these shorts and completely ruined them. This new liner does literally everything the previous iteration didn't, they ride up instantly, bunch up in the front and the back, are constrictive around the thigh and ride up instantly.

The quality is poor; the cut is terrible and uncomfortable; the draw string is on the inside not the outside; the waist band is ineffective and uncomfortable; etc.; etc. The fabric is decent however, and the color is nice.

I was very reluctant to buy Lulu Lemon as I had viewed it as a yoga brand (which I do not do) and female brand (I am a male) not a running brand. I have now logged over 600 miles over the past 6 months with these shorts and just bought my third pair. First, the liner inside is amazing. It's more comfortable then compression shorts because it is not as tight and is better at sweat wicking to use but still holds everything in place and reduces chafing. The phone pocket allows me to carry my iPhone 7 on runs without having to use a separate phone holder armband. I was surprised how wow the phone pocket works with no bounce and complete comfort. It's also easily accessible for a mid-run picture as you past beautiful scenery. The back pocket is great for holding my house keys and an emergency credit card. I was worried at first that it did not have a zipper but it honestly works better than a different brand I have that has a zipper. The sweat-wicking properties of these shorts do a better job than other running brands I have used in the past. The fit is great. I wear a 34 or 36 inch waist depending on brand and I am 6 foot 195 lbs. The XL fit better than any other shorts I have ever worn. My wife and friends have commented how well they look on me. The last thing about these shorts they are high quality. I have been using them 3-4 times a week for long runs up to 50k for 6 months and washing them constantly since I did not want to commit to buying another pair until I was sure I loved them. They have held up extremely well. These shorts have converted me and I know have bought other lulu lemon clothing for my wardrobe.",No Response,No Response,0,0,1715,0,USA

He usually wears them without underwear, and has not had any issues with popping out, since they are a good length. They have room to move, without being baggy, and just enough stretch in the material to allow him to get into half pigeon pose with ease. He was worried about pockets getting in the way, but the material is low profile and the pockets have turned out to be convenient. He loves how quickly they dry. I usually hang dry our workout clothes, and I've noticed these shorts dry faster than anything else. They are excellent for wicking away sweat. Now every time we get ready for yoga class he asks me ""are the Lululemon shorts clean?""",No Response,No Response,6,0,965,0,USA

They're a great length - not too short and not too long - and they are very lightweight and comfortable. Fit true to size as well.

They also removed the zipper in the back pocket which makes laying on your back a lot more comfortable while exercising.

I have muscular legs, but nothing crazy, and size M fits me perfect. I use these shorts for legit running, so my review is based on that primary function. As a casual short, they are super comfortable, but they are short, so be respectful of others. Lulu running shorts have been hit or miss in past years and I'm happy to say that they get an A- on these. I normally stick with the 5"" length when shopping for running shorts and the 4"" on these are no different then any of the 5"" runners I already own from other brands. Its short enough that the freedom of movement is there, but not too short that you're second guessing going out in public. The longer liner (it doesn't stick out of the bottom, so don't worry about that) is super comfortable and is life changing vs. the normal liner I find in other brands. I was skeptical at first about the ""new and improved"" liner, but having logged lots of miles, I'm super happy and have no reservations (or chafing). The pocket in the back is reasonable in size for the basic keys and snacks, and an iPhoneX kinda fits, but its a little wonky. There is also a pocket on the right thigh in the liners that fits a phone, but it feels a little funny running with it there (although it does work). My only suggestion for improvement would be that the these sit a little high on my waist then what I'd prefer, but its not a deal breaker, just a personal preference. Overall, they are super comfortable and functional, and are my go-to short when I want to look good, feel good, and run fast...can't go wrong.",No Response,No Response,2,0,1631,0,USA

I have this medium length hair that's too short to be tied and too long to be quaffed backed, I look like one of those trolls dolls. Hence the use of headbands. I've been using bandana's but they get drenched in sweat and I wanted to treat myself, as a way of self-congratulating for being one step closer to my dream. So I purchased this lululemon headband. At first it fit fine, sure it was a tad loose. But as I workout and get down and dirty, the headband seems to shift a bit. My hair gathers it's strength and decides to unleash itself and the headband slips right off. I wonder if my head is just a weird shape or if my hair is truly that powerful.

Though old versions of this shirt seem more durable as this shirt is very thin and light...possibly prone to holes as I read from other reviews. The Teal version of this shirt however has a completely different fit then the other two colors. Very tight almost like spandex and I have never worn anything but large shirts from LuLu. Will be returning the teal but keeping the navy and black. Truly hope the quality of LuLu makes a comeback since how durable and comfortable the clothing always has been is why I don’t mind paying a premium for these clothes.

I've always loved the fabric/feel/stretchiness of all 4 of my surge tanks and have never had a problem with them. I mainly order online for convenience, but the last time I was in the store buying additional items for my wife, I picked up another surge tank and really liked the dark maroon color of a metal vent tank so I bought it as well. This tank feels great and has all the benefits of the surge tank without the extra holes/vents. Now my bad experience....since I liked the metal vent tank I bought in stores so much, I purchased two more when they were on sale online. I got them in a very dark green/black color and a deep cobalt blue color. Both tanks feel nothing like any of the prior tanks i purchased. The material is very rough on the skin, scratchy/itchy, and almost seems like a harder material that doesn't have as much stretch. Needless to say i'm very disappointed in the purchase of these two as they seem like a whole different tank from a cheaper quality brand. At first I just thought it was the style and lucked out by getting an extra soft one with the maroon tank I first purchased, but after going back into a store and trying on a grey and a white metal vent tank I'm convinced there's a quality assurance issue or somethings wrong with the fabric. I have to be careful pulling/stretching out the tank when it clings to me because it already seems to be pilling and the seams might come undone if i pull too hard (would never happen stretching the surge tank out or my other maroon metal vent tank). I guess from now on i'll stick to the surge tanks because they feel amazing and haven't let me down so far.",2018-06-07 00:00:00,"Hi PupFamTXCO, I'm sorry to read of your experience.

The tanks are supposed to wick off sweat for lightness and breathability but it acts more like a sponge. They absorb all my sweat and weighs it down after 20 minutes of exercise (fyi, I'm not a heady sweater, just normal). The sweat absorption causes you to get very cold if you don't have a spare shirt to change in. It actually caused me to get a mildly sick one time due to how much liquid was on my body and the cold temperature of the gym. Ever since, I either avoid wearing these or bring a spare shirt to change if I'm out of workout clothes (a huge inconvenience in the middle of a workout).

I am not the a smelly or overly sweaty guy, I bought the tank because I liked the look and fit not necessarily the anti-stink feature. Let me tell you the shirt STINKS before you even wear it, right out of the wash the shirt smells I couldn't even stand the smell through out my work out. It smells like some kind of copper or metal (hence the name). But I don't understand this logic, why make a shirt that is suppose to mitigate POTENTIAL stinkiness coming from sweat and bacteria by creating a product/fabric and inherently stinks to begin with. I was very upset when it made all my other clothes in the wash stink as well. I tried washing it again after the first wash with more detergent and the smell would not go away. I wouldn't recommend buy anything from the metal vent line for this reason. Lululemon shorts are second-to-none, I have dozens of their shorts but this tank is a no no. Luckily, I didn't wash or wear the metal vent henley I also bought so I will definitely be returning that.

After having to do laundry every few days to keep my gym clothes from having that funky smell that you can never get rid of I decided to try these Metal Vent Tech products and I was impressed. After a month or so I decided that it was time to look at updating all my gym shirts to products like this and eliminated basically anything cotton from my gym bag. In doing so I went to my local lululemon store and I purchased a number of Metal Vent Tech items including this 1/2 Zip and also a Metal Vent Tech hoodie. I don't really wear these items to workout in like I do the shirts and tanks. So they really shouldn't have much wear on them. Much to my surprise this garment as well as the hoodie are made of what would appear to be a lighter weight fabric than the shirts and tanks. The fact that warmer weather garments are made of a lighter weight fabric seemed a bit baffling to me. However the most troubling thing for me was that after only one wash, both of these garments did not fair well. They showed a lot of wear and had significant pilling. The pills would easily snag or get caught on things and cause small holes or tears in the fabric over time. I might understand this happening if I hadn't taken care in washing the garments. However, I had just purchased a new front loading washer and washed these two garments by themselves in cold water. I attempted to return the items without luck so they sat at the back of my closet until recently when i was going through things and found them. I decided to give them to goodwill and was reminded that I should write a review so that others are cautioned against purchasing this garment, or others that are made from the lighter weight material used here. I made the assumption that all items with the name Metal Vent Tech were made of the same fabric, but clearly they are not. While I have had a great experience with most of the shirts and tanks, this experience makes me cautious as purchasing other Metal Vent Tech products.",2017-10-27 00:00:00,"Hey GregoryGearGuy, Thanks so much for sharing your thoughts today.

Sock. I think that over the last 9-12 months LLL has made major improvements to T.H.E. around sizing, cushioning, and choice of materials. Best sock of this kind out there as far as I can tell. So when I needed a thinner, lighter sock for snugger shoes I hoped that the Surge Sock would be equally as good. Not by a mile. Yes Surge is comfortable and breathable, but it has much less support of than T.H.E., especially in the front as well as the heel. More importantly, the design is just weird: why does the stiching on the ankles have large protruding hems? And the toe cut/stitching is not as form fitting as T.H.E., leaving extra material hanging off the toes. Also one pair I got had material already coming undone straight out of the package. The other issue for me is pricing. Many people have commented on the pricing of both T.H.E. and Surge. For the sake of argument, let's say that T.H.E. is appropriately priced. If so, then how the heck can you charge the same amount for a sock that uses less and mostly thinner material, has almost none of the major cushioning and support features, and has a much more basic patterning and coloring design than T.H.E.? Simply makes no sense. T.H.E. is far better product which undoubtedly involves much more work at yet it costs exactly the same? Even without the flaws described above, the Surge is a $10 - $12 sock.

I wasn't too disappointed as the sizing chart said I would be the larger size; so, exchanged that pair in the store for a L/XL. After trying on those, they were way too big, and would either have to be pulled up so high that they looked goofy, and the heel would be out of place, or they would be bunched up under the middle of my foot.

I am a personal trainer so comfort and functionality is really important to me as I am in these shorts all day.

I have a muscular build and do do a lot of Olympic lifting in these things, but I can't imagine I put the fabric under any more stress as some yoga poses would. At this point, it has become quite embarrassing to keep returning to the local store with this same problem. Nor do I want to continue switching these shorts out for another pair with the same problem. Sadly, these shorts have been the poorest quality of any other pair in my closet. I gave Lulu the benefit of the doubt at first, but I think simply claiming to have the ""best"" quality products doesn't work if you can't back it up. Judging by other reviews of this product, this is an issue that has been brought to your attention a while ago, with still no effective solution?

I can handle the zipper style pockets for a key or ID card but pockets for the hands are usually a NO-GO for me. I have to say that I am surprised with these shorts. First, the liner. I wore the shorts to lift weights and do elliptical cardio. The liner in these shorts is a thin bike short style and not the bikini brief style of the Light as Air version. I was unsure if this would provide any support but surprisingly, it did. It didn't feel like it was providing me support but I didn't have to 'adjust' myself at all during the workout. The positioning of the (hand) pockets makes them not bugle out either which I like. My only complaint would be using these to run. I went for a good run that same afternoon in the shorts and the liner was not really strong enough to provide running support for the package. There was a few adjustments made during the run but nothing too bad. There was no chaffing with my legs so that is a plus. So the question is, would I buy more of these. The answer is, YES! I like the styling and the function of the shorts. Like I said, didn't think that these would perform in my usual workout in the gym but they did. I probably would not run them but definitely would lift in them. The fit for me was pretty good too. They came just above the knees on me. I also liked the styling.

The older Response shorts and shorter length run shorts had the secure pocket in the small of your back so that nothing would move around when running. This was genius. Secondly, the fit is a little off on these as well. I am a small in all Lulu bottoms and these are too small, but the Mediums were too big and because they were too small the liner started to rise real quick. Needless to say, one run and done with these. I'll stick with my old shorts.",2011-02-23 00:00:00,"Hey Wesley,  Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback for the Run:Response Short.

However, these are 2 concerns: 1) the sizing seems inconsistent - 2017 models seem to be cut tighter with shorter sleeves. I found out the hard and expensive way. I assumed that the same size from last year would fit so I tore the tags off only to find that the shirt was skin tight.

They even reinforced the edges of the to make absolutely certain there is weight to drag this thing uncomfortably on any part of your sweaty neck it can.

Unfortunately, after a couple of washes (in which I followed the washing and drying instructions), the black mesh part in the crotch area began to pill, and now, unfortunately, a small hole has appeared along the seam. This is so disappointing, because I don't think they will last more than a couple of more washes. I probably haven't worn either short more than ten times each, and have only washed them a few times. I have Adidas shorts, Puma shorts and Under Armour shorts at half the price, that I've worn for years and are still as good as the day I bought them. There is obviously a flaw in the design and material being used. This quality is unacceptable.",2015-08-22 00:00:00,"Hi Miken543, Thanks for taking the time to reach out to us.

The drawstring, if you can call it that, does not do what it is intended to do, i.e. to tighten your shorts. The design that they use is flawed. 4.

The placement of the pocket is on the side, so if you place your keys in the key pocket, it is constantly rubbing during a run. Nike and most other manufacturers place this on the backside so there's no rubbing. First problem is that you feel the key the entire run. Secondly, this wears through the material.

I believe the description is inaccurate, though--the liner seems to be a brief liner to me (which is what's depicted), not a boxer-brief liner. I don't know yet about all the pockets in the liner. I like the idea, but worry about the gels I carry being directly against my skin over the course of a long run of 2-3 hours.

Both shorts exhibited this. Now the shorts are stretched and look disgusting with the permanent wrinkles (almost look like ruffles). I attribute this to the thin fabric not being able to hold it's formed integrity. Needless to say, I wasted $140 on two pairs of shorts that don't fit well and embarrassing to wear. I expected much more from my first pieces of Lululemon clothing. The closest B&M store is 2 hours away so I didn't have a chance to try to return them. I decided to give the company another shot and bought the regular surge shorts. So far so good, even after a few washes.

I did some research, and thought this would be a great first piece for him, especially being on mark down. In store I found the grey color. He tried it on, and loved it. He said it was very comfortable, and liked the looser fit. He is also a generally sweaty guy, so having the anti-stink technology is really helpful. He loves this shirt so much that he wears it almost everywhere; to class, working out, walking the dogs, hanging around the house, running errands etc. It is the perfect shirt for spring, summer, and fall. Winter it won't be warm enough here, but I think it would be a good layering piece. The reason that I like this shirt is because it's very flattering on my husband. Specifically the stitching on the upper neck-area of the shirt. Finding a shirt that not only feels good physically, but makes him feel good mentally is a win-win.
