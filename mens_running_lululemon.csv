I own at least 7 pairs, as I sometimes am on a 2-a-day schedule. I purchased the new version (not realizing it was a new version). The sizing is off, but most importantly are the pockets. They always used to lay flat, and they were sized correctly to hold a phone. Now, they gap open (making the shorts look too tight, which they are not) and are so wide that an iPhone 8 slides to its side, making it very hard to take it out of your pocket. It remained vertical in the old shorts (because the pocket was too narrow for it to turn to its side). You would never know this in the store because who puts a phone in the shorts pocket when trying on?? Also, the liner is already starting to come unstitched at a seam.

The new version eliminates the double vertical mesh fabric stripes that were a really neat feature of the original and they also swapped the tiny zipper pocket to the right side, which is a little annoying.

I ordered my new Pace Breakers in the Canopy Hot Heat Mach Blue, a color/pattern combination which is pure genius and I love!! When they arrived in the mail, I noticed that the new Medium does not fit like the old one and it’s a lot tighter and not as comfortable as the old version.

Sure, the new, updated liner is a horrible downgrade from the old liner, and sure it is uncomfortable and makes for shorts that don't sit well as others have noted, but the liner is only one of the new problems with the updated version of the shorts. There are a few others, but two especially are worth mentioning. First, the design of the hand pockets changed from a well-fit and well-cut vertical arrangement that kept the outer fabric of the pocket close to the shorts, to a diagonal, loose arrangement that causes the outer pocket to curve away from the shorts, creating a large, goofy arc. Second, although an aesthetic issue, the designers also removed the vertical mesh stripe on each side of the leg that complemented the rainbow mesh across the seat (which they retained) and which made for an interesting look.

They're the absolute best shorts for training I've ever encountered. The built in liner was my favorite part about them, it was light weight, the perfect length, never bunched up in the front or back, never chaffed, never rode up, yet was supportive and comfortable. These new liners are complete garbage. They took everything that was great about these shorts and completely ruined them. This new liner does literally everything the previous iteration didn't, they ride up instantly, bunch up in the front and the back, are constrictive around the thigh and ride up instantly. These have provided some of the most uncomfortable workouts in recent memory. It boggles my mind how you could take something that was literally perfect and redesign it so poorly.

I bought two of the metal vent tech shirts and two 9” pace breaker shorts (lined). I was converted to the product as soon as I worked out in it so I bought two more of this combination. Last month, I bought the same outfit, size but noticed it said “updated” I the title description. When the “updated” metal vent shirt and lined 9” pace breaker shorts (size large) arrived, my excitement immediately turned to disappointment once I tried each item on. I’m 6’1” 182lbs and the previous design of the shirt and shorts fit so well I wear them as lifestyle gear, not just to the gym. The “updated” version is so tight I would have to lose 20 lbs to reasonably fit in it. The liner in the shorts is smaller and much tighter than the previous generation (and very uncomfortable). I returned both items to the store and asked if the had any of the old gear for sale (they were sold out). I hope my original purchase of metal vent shirts and 9” lined pace breaker shorts last a long time. I won’t be make any new purchases until the “updated” version goes back to the 2017 version.

It is incredibly tight, rides up and gets stuck, and is far too compressive.

burned and the only thing of any quality left is the customer service.
I have no idea why they decided to make these short, but they did an
absolutely terrible job. The quality is poor; the cut is terrible and
uncomfortable; the draw string is on the inside not the outside; the
waist band is ineffective and uncomfortable; etc.; etc. The fabric is
decent however, and the color is nice. That’s about it. It seems very
apparent that Lululemon is either not speaking with its customers to
find out what they want, or they are doing like Nike and catering to a
few zealous customers and freezing out the majority. Either way, I may
very well be done with them, I’m tired of returning stuff or having it

I was very reluctant to buy Lulu Lemon as I had viewed it as a yoga brand (which I do not do) and female brand (I am a male) not a running brand. I have now logged over 600 miles over the past 6 months with these shorts and just bought my third pair. First, the liner inside is amazing. It's more comfortable then compression shorts because it is not as tight and is better at sweat wicking to use but still holds everything in place and reduces chafing. The phone pocket allows me to carry my iPhone 7 on runs without having to use a separate phone holder armband. I was surprised how wow the phone pocket works with no bounce and complete comfort. It's also easily accessible for a mid-run picture as you past beautiful scenery. The back pocket is great for holding my house keys and an emergency credit card. I was worried at first that it did not have a zipper but it honestly works better than a different brand I have that has a zipper. The sweat-wicking properties of these shorts do a better job than other running brands I have used in the past. The fit is great. I wear a 34 or 36 inch waist depending on brand and I am 6 foot 195 lbs. The XL fit better than any other shorts I have ever worn. My wife and friends have commented how well they look on me. The last thing about these shorts they are high quality. I have been using them 3-4 times a week for long runs up to 50k for 6 months and washing them constantly since I did not want to commit to buying another pair until I was sure I loved them. They have held up extremely well. These shorts have converted me and I know have bought other lulu lemon clothing for my wardrobe.",,,0,0,1715,bottom,shorts

The only thing that LuLulemon needs to improve on is the actual fitting of their clothes (most importantly these shorts). There's just always very minor things, like with these shorts it's the inseam of the shorts meaning its too baggy and loose making them look like a skirt at some times. I'm a 30 inch waist and I bought these in a medium and it was way to tight. Ending up going for the large and it fits but at the price of baggyness. Would price the value of these around 35$ at most.

I ordered them online, but the liner was so uncomfortable that I took them back to the store, thinking a large may be better. I bought them and took them home to try for a bit. The large did fit a bit better (which was odd because I don't wear a large in anything). Even then, the liner could not have been more uncomfortable! I tried to roll the liner up but it only made it worse. Hopefully they go back to the old liner which feels much more natural, while still keeping everything down there in place.

Run a least marathon a year, (qualified for Boston). I have been using running shorts from other brands for many years and have been very happy with them. Recently, several friends enticed to try Lululemon. So I got this running short, which was sold to me at the store as the quintessential Lululemon running short. When I asked for a running short with a zipped pocket, I was told by the store employee that Lululemon doesn't have any (which was misleading since I later found some on this website). So I got this pair of short. I still haven't used it. The lack of zipped pocket is a deal braker for me = no place to put my keys/id. And I am still not 100% confident that the pocket could hold my phone. Gels maybe, but I don't want to risk loosing and/or breaking my phone.

I ordered every color and even in two sizes, just to make sure the fit was right. Well, I eagerly jumped into my fresh shorts for Monday morning practice and only about 20 minutes in I was in agony. The liner of the shorts kept riding up causing a chain reaction that though it's hard to describe here, let's just say that these shorts are ball crushers!I tried everything, pulled liner down over and over, adjusted, tightened and loosened waistband, nothing worked. Frustrated, I went home and examined the shorts to try and identify the source of my, um, discomfort. Don't know what it is exactly, but the liner just doesn't have the appropriate shape/pouch for, well, you know. I have never really experienced this issue and certainly not in the nearly 100 pairs of Lulu bottoms (shorts, trainers, briefs, pants, joggers, Etc). Hoping this is glitch in the newly released design and that future versions will be more, um, ""roomy"". Ever-faithful!",2018-05-17,"Hi FaithfulChiYogi,

I really like the new lining on the inside. Instead of being a simple net, they have made a very flexible, comfortable built-in compression material (with a small pocket stitched into the right leg) which I like! Instead of the zippered back pocket, they have the band of the shorts fold over a small pocket in the back. Feels a little cheap and I preferred the zippered pocket. With these small changes, I prefer the older style, but these are still nice! In terms of the color, they are VERY white (which I love), but be prepared for them to get dirty quickly. Overall they fit great and I'm very pleased!",,,3,5,687,bottom,shorts

They have room to move, without being baggy, and just enough stretch in the material to allow him to get into half pigeon pose with ease. He was worried about pockets getting in the way, but the material is low profile and the pockets have turned out to be convenient. He loves how quickly they dry.

These are hands down the best shorts that Lulu makes. My only complaint about the other pacebreaker shorts that I've been wearing for years was the liner. The seam down the middle of the front in the liner of the others was ungodly huge and chafed me like crazy in the most sensitive of areas, so I had to start cutting out the liners so I could wear underwear underneath. Lo and behold, Lulu answered my prayers and came out with these. They're perfect for pretty much any activity. They're a great length - not too short and not too long - and they are very lightweight and comfortable. Fit true to size as well. Some other shorts with the elastic waist band tend to run a little small. For reference, I'm 6'1"" with a 33"" waist and go with a L in these. I wear them for spin, running, lifting, or when I want to throw on something quick and comfortable to run around. Lulu, you've got a winner here.",,,3,0,920,bottom,shorts

It requires much more adjustment than the older liner and tends to ride up. It also retains smell much more than the original so you can only wear them for one hard workout before a wash, it's the biggest flaw of the redesign. The original version I could wear a few times and not feel guilty. My favorite part of the original was that I NEVER had to adjust the liner and the shorts were just effortless and comfortable for all day wear. I cannot say the same for the updated version. I will say the redesigned back pocket is actually really useful and a cool design.

I have muscular legs, but nothing crazy, and size M fits me perfect. I use these shorts for legit running, so my review is based on that primary function. As a casual short, they are super comfortable, but they are short, so be respectful of others. Lulu running shorts have been hit or miss in past years and I'm happy to say that they get an A- on these. I normally stick with the 5"" length when shopping for running shorts and the 4"" on these are no different then any of the 5"" runners I already own from other brands. Its short enough that the freedom of movement is there, but not too short that you're second guessing going out in public. The longer liner (it doesn't stick out of the bottom, so don't worry about that) is super comfortable and is life changing vs. the normal liner I find in other brands. I was skeptical at first about the ""new and improved"" liner, but having logged lots of miles, I'm super happy and have no reservations (or chafing). The pocket in the back is reasonable in size for the basic keys and snacks, and an iPhoneX kinda fits, but its a little wonky. There is also a pocket on the right thigh in the liners that fits a phone, but it feels a little funny running with it there (although it does work). My only suggestion for improvement would be that the these sit a little high on my waist then what I'd prefer, but its not a deal breaker, just a personal preference. Overall, they are super comfortable and functional, and are my go-to short when I want to look good, feel good, and run fast...can't go wrong.",,,2,0,1631,bottom,shorts

There's nothing like living life with clothes that squeeze you into feeling like you're still in your mother's womb. Anyway, about the headband. It has always been my dream to have a man bun, but let me tell you, it has been one awkward journey. I have this medium length hair that's too short to be tied and too long to be quaffed backed, I look like one of those trolls dolls. Hence the use of headbands. I've been using bandana's but they get drenched in sweat and I wanted to treat myself, as a way of self-congratulating for being one step closer to my dream. So I purchased this lululemon headband. At first it fit fine, sure it was a tad loose. But as I workout and get down and dirty, the headband seems to shift a bit. My hair gathers it's strength and decides to unleash itself and the headband slips right off. I wonder if my head is just a weird shape or if my hair is truly that powerful. I like the product, but it just doesnt fit well. Maybe on your own man bun journey this may be a great addition. But sadly my sweaty bandanas that are significantly cheaper work better for me.",2018-07-23,"Hi PowerHair,

What I don't like about this shirt is that it seems to lose its shape very quickly and it seems to run big. At first, when you put it on it seems to be an athletic cut, but not long after you start wearing it the shape is lost and it kind of becomes baggy.

This is the first review I have written about any product from LuLu and that coming from someone who who has shopped LuLu for the past 8 years and wears some kind of LuLu clothing almost everyday of my life. Recently bought this shirt in 3 different colors navy, black, and teal. Navy and black shirts fit great as always and are comfortable to wear when working out or as casual. Though old versions of this shirt seem more durable as this shirt is very thin and light...possibly prone to holes as I read from other reviews. The Teal version of this shirt however has a completely different fit then the other two colors. Very tight almost like spandex and I have never worn anything but large shirts from LuLu. Will be returning the teal but keeping the navy and black. Truly hope the quality of LuLu makes a comeback since how durable and comfortable the clothing always has been is why I don’t mind paying a premium for these clothes.

After having to do laundry every few days to keep my gym clothes from having that funky smell that you can never get rid of I decided to try these Metal Vent Tech products and I was impressed. After a month or so I decided that it was time to look at updating all my gym shirts to products like this and eliminated basically anything cotton from my gym bag. In doing so I went to my local lululemon store and I purchased a number of Metal Vent Tech items including this 1/2 Zip and also a Metal Vent Tech hoodie. I don't really wear these items to workout in like I do the shirts and tanks. So they really shouldn't have much wear on them. Much to my surprise this garment as well as the hoodie are made of what would appear to be a lighter weight fabric than the shirts and tanks. The fact that warmer weather garments are made of a lighter weight fabric seemed a bit baffling to me. However the most troubling thing for me was that after only one wash, both of these garments did not fair well. They showed a lot of wear and had significant pilling. The pills would easily snag or get caught on things and cause small holes or tears in the fabric over time. I might understand this happening if I hadn't taken care in washing the garments. However, I had just purchased a new front loading washer and washed these two garments by themselves in cold water. I attempted to return the items without luck so they sat at the back of my closet until recently when i was going through things and found them. I decided to give them to goodwill and was reminded that I should write a review so that others are cautioned against purchasing this garment, or others that are made from the lighter weight material used here. I made the assumption that all items with the name Metal Vent Tech were made of the same fabric, but clearly they are not. While I have had a great experience with most of the shirts and tanks, this experience makes me cautious as purchasing other Metal Vent Tech products.",2017-10-27,"Hey GregoryGearGuy,

I've always loved the fabric/feel/stretchiness of all 4 of my surge tanks and have never had a problem with them. I mainly order online for convenience, but the last time I was in the store buying additional items for my wife, I picked up another surge tank and really liked the dark maroon color of a metal vent tank so I bought it as well. This tank feels great and has all the benefits of the surge tank without the extra holes/vents.
Now my bad experience....since I liked the metal vent tank I bought in stores so much, I purchased two more when they were on sale online. I got them in a very dark green/black color and a deep cobalt blue color. Both tanks feel nothing like any of the prior tanks i purchased. The material is very rough on the skin, scratchy/itchy, and almost seems like a harder material that doesn't have as much stretch. Needless to say i'm very disappointed in the purchase of these two as they seem like a whole different tank from a cheaper quality brand. At first I just thought it was the style and lucked out by getting an extra soft one with the maroon tank I first purchased, but after going back into a store and trying on a grey and a white metal vent tank I'm convinced there's a quality assurance issue or somethings wrong with the fabric. I have to be careful pulling/stretching out the tank when it clings to me because it already seems to be pilling and the seams might come undone if i pull too hard (would never happen stretching the surge tank out or my other maroon metal vent tank).
I guess from now on i'll stick to the surge tanks because they feel amazing and haven't let me down so far.",2018-06-07,"Hi PupFamTXCO,

These are not the same quality as before. I wear these to play basketball and weight lifting, and let me tell you, they are not great quality for those type of exercises. The tanks are supposed to wick off sweat for lightness and breathability but it acts more like a sponge. They absorb all my sweat and weighs it down after 20 minutes of exercise (fyi, I'm not a heady sweater, just normal). The sweat absorption causes you to get very cold if you don't have a spare shirt to change in. It actually caused me to get a mildly sick one time due to how much liquid was on my body and the cold temperature of the gym. Ever since, I either avoid wearing these or bring a spare shirt to change if I'm out of workout clothes (a huge inconvenience in the middle of a workout). I would definitely stay away from these and try a different brand that will do what it is meant to do.

Let me tell you the shirt STINKS before you even wear it, right out of the wash the shirt smells I couldn't even stand the smell through out my work out. It smells like some kind of copper or metal (hence the name). But I don't understand this logic, why make a shirt that is suppose to mitigate POTENTIAL stinkiness coming from sweat and bacteria by creating a product/fabric and inherently stinks to begin with. I was very upset when it made all my other clothes in the wash stink as well. I tried washing it again after the first wash with more detergent and the smell would not go away. I wouldn't recommend buy anything from the metal vent line for this reason. Lululemon shorts are second-to-none, I have dozens of their shorts but this tank is a no no.

I think that over the last 9-12 months LLL has made major improvements to T.H.E. around sizing, cushioning, and choice of materials. Best sock of this kind out there as far as I can tell.
So when I needed a thinner, lighter sock for snugger shoes I hoped that the Surge Sock would be equally as good. Not by a mile. Yes Surge is comfortable and breathable, but it has much less support of than T.H.E., especially in the front as well as the heel. More importantly, the design is just weird: why does the stiching on the ankles have large protruding hems? And the toe cut/stitching is not as form fitting as T.H.E., leaving extra material hanging off the toes. Also one pair I got had material already coming undone straight out of the package.
The other issue for me is pricing. Many people have commented on the pricing of both T.H.E. and Surge. For the sake of argument, let's say that T.H.E. is appropriately priced. If so, then how the heck can you charge the same amount for a sock that uses less and mostly thinner material, has almost none of the major cushioning and support features, and has a much more basic patterning and coloring design than T.H.E.? Simply makes no sense. T.H.E. is far better product which undoubtedly involves much more work at yet it costs exactly the same? Even without the flaws described above, the Surge is a $10 - $12 sock. Unless you have $ to burn, go with T.H.E.",2018-09-04,"Dear Ericsf7,

I wasn't too disappointed as the sizing chart said I would be the larger size; so, exchanged that pair in the store for a L/XL. After trying on those, they were way too big, and would either have to be pulled up so high that they looked goofy, and the heel would be out of place, or they would be bunched up under the middle of my foot.

Surge Sock,14,3.1,2,ERICSF7,"LOS ANGELES, CA",SWEATY GENERALIST,45-54,MUSCULAR,,,,Very disappointed,2018-09-04,"I buy a lot from LLL including many pairs of T.H.E. Sock. I think that over the last 9-12 months LLL has made major improvements to T.H.E. around sizing, cushioning, and choice of materials. Best sock of this kind out there as far as I can tell.
So when I needed a thinner, lighter sock for snugger shoes I hoped that the Surge Sock would be equally as good. Not by a mile. Yes Surge is comfortable and breathable, but it has much less support of than T.H.E., especially in the front as well as the heel. More importantly, the design is just weird: why does the stiching on the ankles have large protruding hems? And the toe cut/stitching is not as form fitting as T.H.E., leaving extra material hanging off the toes. Also one pair I got had material already coming undone straight out of the package.
The other issue for me is pricing. Many people have commented on the pricing of both T.H.E. and Surge. For the sake of argument, let's say that T.H.E. is appropriately priced. If so, then how the heck can you charge the same amount for a sock that uses less and mostly thinner material, has almost none of the major cushioning and support features, and has a much more basic patterning and coloring design than T.H.E.? Simply makes no sense. T.H.E. is far better product which undoubtedly involves much more work at yet it costs exactly the same? Even without the flaws described above, the Surge is a $10 - $12 sock. Unless you have $ to burn, go with T.H.E.",2018-09-04,"Dear Ericsf7,

I have at least 10 shorts and one by one, it is slowly happening again. Lululemon does not provide repairs to inner liners anymore, which is very disappointing seeing how the quality of the liners has been extremely poor for years now and I am sure they know seeing the plethora of feedback on such. At the very least, provide liners at cheap cost for replacement. I would've been ok with that but we are forced to spend >$68 for new pairs now.

White and Black have mostly been my go-to's, but it seems like the women's shorts have the best patterns and colors. I totally get that on average, most men prefer plain and basic colors and patterns, but some, like me, have a preference for the creative looks.

That allows me to secure something if I need it secured during periods of high movement, (ID, Keys, Credit Card) or if I am not worried about any of those things falling out (during periods of low movement) then I can keep my items in the regular pockets where they are easier to access. The shorts slide on and off easily, but maintain their grip on my hips when I am sweaty and performing rigorous exercise.

A coworker noticed a small tear on the thigh of my shorts. We determined it must have happened in the wash since it was early in the morning. I get it, these things happen. But when I went into the store to see if they could swap it out for a new pair or something I was very disappointed. I was treated as if I was trying to scheme a free pair of shorts. Definitely makes me question if I will continue to buy clothes from here despite my brand loyalty over the last few years. Sorry but at nearly $70 a pair I would expect better customer service or for them to at least stand by their product and hook me up with a new pair. I was so angry I threw out the torn pair once I got home because I didn't even want to bother with getting them repaired somewhere else.",2016-08-10,"Hey Ahaluska,

First thing, there seems to be a lot of needless material, I'm not sure who's going to be 'pace breaking' in these shorts. That does make them comfortable for around the house but not for serious exercise.
Secondly, these are really too hot to wear in any kind of heat. It's probably as a result of all the excess material but I would steer clear of these if you are planning on running any real distance in these in the heat.

This morning I wore the shorts again to do a light workout where I would be doing sit-ups, and again there was scraping. I even adjusted myself, but no matter what, the stitching was scrapping even deeper into the already existing wound. When I got home and showered, it again severely stung, My wife even said something like that is very abnormal, especially with the lining. It's still very sensitive above my buttcrack, so I've been cautious to not do anything that would irritate it; like sitting on a stool, bike, etc. And just to be clear, the size is also perfectly fine and everything else is rather fine about these shorts.

I could seriously wear these lounging around the house. And it still manages to be resilient enough as they've been through several washes and workouts with no apparent fraying or tearing. 3) Convenience: I love the use of pockets plus the side zip as I tend to keep stuff with me, on runs especially.

I am a personal trainer so comfort and functionality is really important to me as I am in these shorts all day. Which is how I justified spending the extra money for these over a simple pair of UA or Nike shorts. However, I have had issues with the liner wearing thin and ripping at the seam. I have taken 4 pairs back within a years amount of time and apparently some of the employees at the local store have encountered the same problem. I have a muscular build and do do a lot of Olympic lifting in these things, but I can't imagine I put the fabric under any more stress as some yoga poses would. At this point, it has become quite embarrassing to keep returning to the local store with this same problem. Nor do I want to continue switching these shorts out for another pair with the same problem. Sadly, these shorts have been the poorest quality of any other pair in my closet. I gave Lulu the benefit of the doubt at first, but I think simply claiming to have the ""best"" quality products doesn't work if you can't back it up. Judging by other reviews of this product, this is an issue that has been brought to your attention a while ago, with still no effective solution? I'm no designer, but I think that adding two additional seams from front to back within the liner would make it much more durable and potentially prevent this problem from happening to other customers.

Also, the liner is made out of the same COOLMAX fabric as the Game On boxer briefs, and those are my favorite underwear, so these are so comfy. Definitely get a pair, at least just one.

If you walk by anything that sticks out, like in your kitchen by a drawer with a knob or in the gym walking by a barbell on a bench, the pocket will catch it and rip the zipper out rendering the pocket kind of useless.

The salesman at the Raleigh NC lulu store told me about the difference between these shorts and the Light as Air version. I also don't usually like pockets in my workout shorts. I can handle the zipper style pockets for a key or ID card but pockets for the hands are usually a NO-GO for me. I have to say that I am surprised with these shorts. First, the liner. I wore the shorts to lift weights and do elliptical cardio. The liner in these shorts is a thin bike short style and not the bikini brief style of the Light as Air version. I was unsure if this would provide any support but surprisingly, it did. It didn't feel like it was providing me support but I didn't have to 'adjust' myself at all during the workout. The positioning of the (hand) pockets makes them not bugle out either which I like. My only complaint would be using these to run. I went for a good run that same afternoon in the shorts and the liner was not really strong enough to provide running support for the package. There was a few adjustments made during the run but nothing too bad. There was no chaffing with my legs so that is a plus. So the question is, would I buy more of these. The answer is, YES! I like the styling and the function of the shorts. Like I said, didn't think that these would perform in my usual workout in the gym but they did. I probably would not run them but definitely would lift in them. The fit for me was pretty good too. They came just above the knees on me. I also liked the styling.

I bought these shorts to replace some really old UA shorts and they have been nothing but annoying. First the pocket doesn't work, your items will swing around instead of laying flat. I carry one key and a credit card. I agree that the pocket should be up around the waist in the back. Second, the lining will wear thin and rip between the legs. I run 30-40 miles a week distance and then sprint workouts and within a month of use (about twice a week) they are no longer functional. Last, the fabric feels nice and is nice to wear but if you sweat at all they because loose and don't hold to your body. The inside will ride up and spend the last half pulling at them. I maybe the only one who runs in the heat (85+) and sweats so maybe thats not a concern for the designers.

For starters, they claim this to be a ""run"" short but the secure pocket is in the wrong place. I put my house key, i.d. and credit card in the zippered pocket and after 2 minutes the weight low was swinging all over the place and got incredibly annoying fast. The older Response shorts and shorter length run shorts had the secure pocket in the small of your back so that nothing would move around when running. This was genius. Secondly, the fit is a little off on these as well. I am a small in all Lulu bottoms and these are too small, but the Mediums were too big and because they were too small the liner started to rise real quick.

I specifically bought them for beach vball so that he could take a dip in the water but have them dry quickly - sometimes board shorts or actual swim trunks can get heavy when wet. They are great for travelling for that same reason. If you do tours you don't want to pack too much so these are perfect for that. aNd they have that neat little pocket on the side. He wants more, and I think if I want to keep him hygenic I will have to get him at least one more pair.",,,2,0,1173,bottom,shorts

In fact, they fell off as I was running for the subway and without them the weight of the backpack pulls on your shoulders - by the evening I had a sore neck.

I assumed that the same size from last year would fit so I tore the tags off only to find that the shirt was skin tight.

(which I have yet to receive) and then had to re-purchase in store. The same size purchased in store fit more consistent with other Metal Vents I own.

Some great (I have chased a pair of pants to a store 3 states away), some disappoint; but this thing is absolutely horrible. I used it for a run when the weather finally got warmer. I was looking forward to this warm spring run. This thing destroyed the run. It annoyed me to the ends of the earth. Its like it is engineering from the ground up to annoy its unfortunate wearer. I will give it this, the garment is light weight and fabric feels kinda cool, but yet the hood weighs about the times as much as the rest of it so its awkward. The hood drags the garment up you in a weird way and it feels heavy on your back and generally uncomfortable. The collar and zippers are engineered in such a manner that ensures either side is always in the perfect position to drag the zipper clear across your neck. They even reinforced the edges of the to make absolutely certain there is weight to drag this thing uncomfortably on any part of your sweaty neck it can. My neck is raw from the zipper dragging on my run. If this was the only thing I owned from Lululemon, I would probably never return. Its that awful. Blew $100 on something I am never....

I was so happy to find a well-fitting short that wasn't too long for my 5'8' frame. In fact, the length of the short as well as the material, was the real selling point for me. At $64 per pair, I expect a high quality short on every level. Unfortunately, after a couple of washes (in which I followed the washing and drying instructions), the black mesh part in the crotch area began to pill, and now, unfortunately, a small hole has appeared along the seam. This is so disappointing, because I don't think they will last more than a couple of more washes. I probably haven't worn either short more than ten times each, and have only washed them a few times. I have Adidas shorts, Puma shorts and Under Armour shorts at half the price, that I've worn for years and are still as good as the day I bought them.

1. They do not wick perspiration away. Rather, they suck up and retain all your sweat. You would be dryer getting out of a pool.
2. The pocket is way too small it is virtually useless and the zipper is not the best functioning one.
3. The drawstring, if you can call it that, does not do what it is intended to do, i.e. to tighten your shorts. The design that they use is flawed.
4. The ""shirt holder"" strap in the back of the shorts fails. If your shirt is soaked, it almost pulls your shorts down. If your shirt is dry, the bouncing from running will cause your shirt to eventually fall out.
Overall, poorly designed and definitely not how it is marketed.",,,5,7,736,bottom,shorts

A simple solution to that would be making these a split short with 1.5"" to 2"" inseam.

I give them props for going with a traditional black color with a couple new age reflective properties. I haven't utilized the band to tuck the shirt in, which I guess is a nice concept or one could just ditch the shirt in the first place. I'm assuming the fabric for the inaccessible fly is just for looks, for those that feel conscientious wearing running shorts in public places after a run...not me. My two biggest rubs with the shorts is 1) the overall cut of the shorts and 2) the liner width. The cut is a shade on the snug side, given the 3'' length. This could be easily remedied by going to a split design, 1.5 or 2'' in length, or just decreasing the overall length to 2.5'' length. The liner is where Lulu needs to make some serious modifications, however. The liner is way too narrow, it feels like wearing a banana hammock.

First of all, these are a good length for regular training, I run about 35-45 mpw and these are a cooler design (temperature wise). Now the bad news. The placement of the pocket is on the side, so if you place your keys in the key pocket, it is constantly rubbing during a run. Nike and most other manufacturers place this on the backside so there's no rubbing. First problem is that you feel the key the entire run. Secondly, this wears through the material. The liner is also not the most comfortable out there.
For the money, you can get 2-3 pairs of Nike or UA shorts for the same price and probably 70% of the comfort with more longevity. Sad, as I really wanted to like these shorts.",,,5,3,810,bottom,shorts

Great lightweight material, good length, no liner, side pockets and a side-back zippered pocket - overall exactly the versatile workout shorts I needed. Recently purchased 4 more pairs online and all of them came with a waistband that doesn't stretch making the shorts impossible to put on. They fit perfectly once you practically rip the waistband apart trying to squeeze them around the wider thigh/butt region to get them up to your waist. Seems to be a flaw in the new design with the drawstring not being long enough to allow a stretch in the waistband. Thought this was just an issue with the batch I ordered online, so I took them back to the store and tried some on there. Same issue with all of them. Going up a size doesn't help because the waist is too big on size L (but those also have the same issue of not being able to stretch the waistband).

Initial thoughts: great fit, comfortable, super light, and looked great. I had high expectations of Lululemon, based off other customers holding them in high regard and the high price point. I'm an avid gym goer. Expectations were met until the first time I was them. Keep in mind, I wash everything on a gentle cycle with warm water. I've never ruined any of my clothes. After I washed both shorts I knew there was an issue. The bottom third of the shorts were stretched and were permanently wrinkled. I tried to steam the wrinkles out with no luck. Both shorts exhibited this. Now the shorts are stretched and look disgusting with the permanent wrinkles (almost look like ruffles). I attribute this to the thin fabric not being able to hold it's formed integrity. Needless to say, I wasted $140 on two pairs of shorts that don't fit well and embarrassing to wear. I expected much more from my first pieces of Lululemon clothing. The closest B&M store is 2 hours away so I didn't have a chance to try to return them.

For years, as much as I loved seeing women in Lululemons, I was not fond of the brand because they only offered baggy and unflattering pants/shorts for men. I took this as a bit discriminatory (oh, my!! a man in sexy clothes? gross!!). I am a bodybuilder, spend a ton of time in the gym, and I mostly only train in tights, but I've always had to buy other brands. So ... I was extremely excited to discover recently that they are now offering men's tights. I have since bought two and I LOVE them. The material, the construction, the fit, everything is ridiculous (I only wish I could wear them to work!). I would agree with other reviewers that the waist could be a bit lower since high, muffin-top-hiding cuts are not that great for men, but it's not a deal-breaker. I haven't owned them that long so I cannot speak to the durability of the pants but I'm in love with everything else and I will continue to be a brand advocate and consumer for as long as they continue to make tights for men. Now, if you could only help by not promoting the unattractive, self-conscious, desexualizing trend of wearing shorts over tights! Ha, ha. It's silly, people. My advice to men: work hard to develop an above-average body that you are proud to show off and quit hiding.

These are hands down the best shorts that Lulu makes. My only complaint about the other pacebreaker shorts that I've been wearing for years was the liner. The seam down the middle of the front in the liner of the others was ungodly huge and chafed me like crazy in the most sensitive of areas, so I had to start cutting out the liners so I could wear underwear underneath. Lo and behold, Lulu answered my prayers and came out with these. They're perfect for pretty much any activity. They're a great length - not too short and not too long - and they are very lightweight and comfortable. Fit true to size as well. Some other shorts with the elastic waist band tend to run a little small. For reference, I'm 6'1"" with a 33"" waist and go with a L in these. I wear them for spin, running, lifting, or when I want to throw on something quick and comfortable to run around. Lulu, you've got a winner here.",,,3,0,920,bottom,shorts

They always used to lay flat, and they were sized correctly to hold a phone. Now, they gap open (making the shorts look too tight, which they are not) and are so wide that an iPhone 8 slides to its side, making it very hard to take it out of your pocket. It remained vertical in the old shorts (because the pocket was too narrow for it to turn to its side).

There are a few others, but two especially are worth mentioning. First, the design of the hand pockets changed from a well-fit and well-cut vertical arrangement that kept the outer fabric of the pocket close to the shorts, to a diagonal, loose arrangement that causes the outer pocket to curve away from the shorts, creating a large, goofy arc. Second, although an aesthetic issue, the designers also removed the vertical mesh stripe on each side of the leg that complemented the rainbow mesh across the seat (which they retained) and which made for an interesting look.

These new liners are complete garbage. They took everything that was great about these shorts and completely ruined them. This new liner does literally everything the previous iteration didn't, they ride up instantly, bunch up in the front and the back, are constrictive around the thigh and ride up instantly.

I bought two of the metal vent tech shirts and two 9” pace breaker shorts (lined). I was converted to the product as soon as I worked out in it so I bought two more of this combination. Last month, I bought the same outfit, size but noticed it said “updated” I the title description. When the “updated” metal vent shirt and lined 9” pace breaker shorts (size large) arrived, my excitement immediately turned to disappointment once I tried each item on. I’m 6’1” 182lbs and the previous design of the shirt and shorts fit so well I wear them as lifestyle gear, not just to the gym. The “updated” version is so tight I would have to lose 20 lbs to reasonably fit in it. The liner in the shorts is smaller and much tighter than the previous generation (and very uncomfortable). I returned both items to the store and asked if the had any of the old gear for sale (they were sold out). I hope my original purchase of metal vent shirts and 9” lined pace breaker shorts last a long time. I won’t be make any new purchases until the “updated” version goes back to the 2017 version.

It is incredibly tight, rides up and gets stuck, and is far too compressive. The reason I preferred the old liner was the relative loose quality, whereas when lululemon used luxtreme as a liner it was unbelievable tight.

Metal Vent Tech Short Sleeve Henley,78,3.6,4,KY36,"LONG ISLAND, NEW YORK, USA",SWEATY GENERALIST,35-44,ATHLETIC,"color selection, fit after 2nd attempt",durability is a question,,"Love Color Selection, Sizing Inconsistent?",2017-05-28,"The Henley is my favorite and I am pleased that newer and more neutral colors are available this spring. However, these are 2 concerns:
1) the sizing seems inconsistent - 2017 models seem to be cut tighter with shorter sleeves. I found out the hard and expensive way. I assumed that the same size from last year would fit so I tore the tags off only to find that the shirt was skin tight. So I had to request an a return (this was an online purchase) but was only able to receive merchandise credit
(which I have yet to receive) and then had to re-purchase in store. The same size purchased in store fit more consistent with other Metal Vents I own.
2) this years Metal Vent doesn't seem as durable. Pulls very easily compared to previous years models.
Time will tell how well this years Henley holds up but I like the colors offered this season.",,,1,0,846,top,long sleeve

Some great (I have chased a pair of pants to a store 3 states away), some disappoint; but this thing is absolutely horrible. I used it for a run when the weather finally got warmer. I was looking forward to this warm spring run. This thing destroyed the run. It annoyed me to the ends of the earth. Its like it is engineering from the ground up to annoy its unfortunate wearer. I will give it this, the garment is light weight and fabric feels kinda cool, but yet the hood weighs about the times as much as the rest of it so its awkward. The hood drags the garment up you in a weird way and it feels heavy on your back and generally uncomfortable. The collar and zippers are engineered in such a manner that ensures either side is always in the perfect position to drag the zipper clear across your neck. They even reinforced the edges of the to make absolutely certain there is weight to drag this thing uncomfortably on any part of your sweaty neck it can.

I bought two of the metal vent tech shirts and two 9” pace breaker shorts (lined). I was converted to the product as soon as I worked out in it so I bought two more of this combination. Last month, I bought the same outfit, size but noticed it said “updated” I the title description. When the “updated” metal vent shirt and lined 9” pace breaker shorts (size large) arrived, my excitement immediately turned to disappointment once I tried each item on. I’m 6’1” 182lbs and the previous design of the shirt and shorts fit so well I wear them as lifestyle gear, not just to the gym. The “updated” version is so tight I would have to lose 20 lbs to reasonably fit in it. The liner in the shorts is smaller and much tighter than the previous generation (and very uncomfortable). I returned both items to the store and asked if the had any of the old gear for sale (they were sold out). I hope my original purchase of metal vent shirts and 9” lined pace breaker shorts last a long time. I won’t be make any new purchases until the “updated” version goes back to the 2017 version.

This is the first review I have written about any product from LuLu and that coming from someone who who has shopped LuLu for the past 8 years and wears some kind of LuLu clothing almost everyday of my life. Recently bought this shirt in 3 different colors navy, black, and teal. Navy and black shirts fit great as always and are comfortable to wear when working out or as casual. Though old versions of this shirt seem more durable as this shirt is very thin and light...possibly prone to holes as I read from other reviews. The Teal version of this shirt however has a completely different fit then the other two colors. Very tight almost like spandex and I have never worn anything but large shirts from LuLu. Will be returning the teal but keeping the navy and black. Truly hope the quality of LuLu makes a comeback since how durable and comfortable the clothing always has been is why I don’t mind paying a premium for these clothes.

If you just plan on running or working out with no one in sight then I'd recommend this shirt, but otherwise I'm sorry to say I wouldn't. It's a shame.

Fits well, breathes well, and performs well. I use this shirt for most everything, including yoga/exercise, casual events, and just a great everyday shirt. However, the shirt has not held up well to regular use. I launder the shirt according to instructions, and do not use the dryer. The neck line has started pilling pretty badly, and a small hole has developed in the fabric at the navel. Not sure how the hole got there, but anything is possible. The pilling though is something I would expect with a cheaper, poorer quality shirt, not necessarily one at this price point, and not after such short use. It is not so bad that I can't use the shirt, but now it looks ratty enough that I can only wear it for exercise and would not wear it to social occasions.

He said it was very comfortable, and liked the looser fit. He is also a generally sweaty guy, so having the anti-stink technology is really helpful. He loves this shirt so much that he wears it almost everywhere; to class, working out, walking the dogs, hanging around the house, running errands etc. It is the perfect shirt for spring, summer, and fall. Winter it won't be warm enough here, but I think it would be a good layering piece. The reason that I like this shirt is because it's very flattering on my husband. Specifically the stitching on the upper neck-area of the shirt. Finding a shirt that not only feels good physically, but makes him feel good mentally is a win-win.

It's my favorite brand of clothing and I have anywhere from 15-20 articles of clothing currently in my closet which I wear daily. At 6'4 I have a hard time getting clothing that's long enough for me while at the same time not being too baggy. Lulu manages to find the happy medium between the two. This shirt was no different. I tried it on and absolutely loved the fit and like most trips to Lulu, walked out with a new purchase. I was happy to wear the shirt to the gym but after a few washes there was a large amount of pilling on the front of the shirt which looks awful. I washed according to proper instructions but it didn't make a difference. It's the first time I've ever had a quality issue with any of my purchases from here. I will likely continue to shop at Lululemon but I am not happy about this most recent purchase.",2017-07-18,"Hey Newfoundlander,

I have read how fragile the fabric is, so I am always worried I will put a hole in it just from wrestling it on.
I got the women's 2 sizes too big just for the arms to be comfortable. However, the body of the shirt makes me look like a lego guy, round and shapeless, but at least I can put my arms in it without too much of a fight.
I got this shirt because we go mining, and I needed something breathable, easy to take on and off, long sleeved to protect my arms from sun and scrapes, and stink free.
I wore it mining yesterday and I was very comfortable. I could push the sleeves up when I needed to (which I cannot do in the women's), easily put them back down, quickly put my thumbs in the thumbholes and put my gloves back on without a second thought, it was oversized enough that I never felt like my shirt was pulling or I had to adjust it while I'm on the side of a mountain.
As a bonus, when we got off the mountain and were eating dinner at the base, the cooler breeze started to pick up and I was still comfortable.
I like the colors of the women's swiftly, and I will wear it around town, however for function and working, this is the shirt I will be wearing. I only wish men's came in something besides black and grey! Don't men like some color too? I want to be seen when I'm on the side of the hill, not blend in!

It requires much more adjustment than the older liner and tends to ride up. It also retains smell much more than the original so you can only wear them for one hard workout before a wash, it's the biggest flaw of the redesign. The original version I could wear a few times and not feel guilty. My favorite part of the original was that I NEVER had to adjust the liner and the shorts were just effortless and comfortable for all day wear. I cannot say the same for the updated version. I will say the redesigned back pocket is actually really useful and a cool design.

I have muscular legs, but nothing crazy, and size M fits me perfect. I use these shorts for legit running, so my review is based on that primary function. As a casual short, they are super comfortable, but they are short, so be respectful of others. Lulu running shorts have been hit or miss in past years and I'm happy to say that they get an A- on these. I normally stick with the 5"" length when shopping for running shorts and the 4"" on these are no different then any of the 5"" runners I already own from other brands. Its short enough that the freedom of movement is there, but not too short that you're second guessing going out in public. The longer liner (it doesn't stick out of the bottom, so don't worry about that) is super comfortable and is life changing vs. the normal liner I find in other brands. I was skeptical at first about the ""new and improved"" liner, but having logged lots of miles, I'm super happy and have no reservations (or chafing). The pocket in the back is reasonable in size for the basic keys and snacks, and an iPhoneX kinda fits, but its a little wonky. There is also a pocket on the right thigh in the liners that fits a phone, but it feels a little funny running with it there (although it does work). My only suggestion for improvement would be that the these sit a little high on my waist then what I'd prefer, but its not a deal breaker, just a personal preference. Overall, they are super comfortable and functional, and are my go-to short when I want to look good, feel good, and run fast...can't go wrong.",,,2,0,1631,bottom,shorts

I do not understand why you have to change things that are not broken. I may have to venture on other brands as there’s no other 4” or 5” shorts you have with the regular liners anymore. An associate suggested purchasing other shorts w/ the liners I want & just have it tailored (as that's free) so it'll be the same length. It's so much of a hassle.

Just hate that in less than 6 months and 15 washes the shirt hasn't lasted as long as all the other clothes I wear. - Metal vent tanks etc are lasting wonderfully - also worn and washed once weekly in the rotation.",2016-05-10,"Hey Kettlebell,

At first I thought it was a lot of money (over $120) for a pair of shorts and shirt but I figured if it kept me comfortable and semi-dry during a workout it would be worth it. After doing a Baptiste yoga class with my new lululemon gear I was very upset with how the clothes performed. I do admit the shorts worked out pretty nicely and were almost completely dry like I would have expected after the class ended. The ($64) shirt was awful. Not only was I soaked after the workout (it did not keep my cool during yoga) I had to hang around the yoga studio for a party afterwards with some of the yogis outside. It was a brisk night when I walked outside and for over an hour the shirt just would not dry. I was freezing! For the price we pay for your clothes I expect quality. I have clothes from Old Navy that are a fraction of the price that performed better than this. If I could I would return at least the shirt in a heartbeat but I understand that isnt possible after wearing it. I would really appreciate some feedback and let me know if this is the quality I should expect if I buy any more clothes.",2014-06-21,"Hi kubes9236,
