They are definitely breathable, but I'm not sure if that's because they are so thin or if there's actually something special about the material. The anti-stink technology does seem to work fairly well. If I let them air out overnight, any stench would be gone the next day. What I don't like about this shirt is that it seems to lose its shape very quickly and it seems to run big. At first, when you put it on it seems to be an athletic cut, but not long after you start wearing it the shape is lost and it kind of becomes baggy. Now, I almost wish I had ordered a size smaller because I hate baggy clothing. It's a decent shirt but doesn't seem worth the cost.","July 31, 2018","Dear kvw84,

This is the first review I have written about any product from LuLu and that coming from someone who who has shopped LuLu for the past 8 years and wears some kind of LuLu clothing almost everyday of my life. Recently bought this shirt in 3 different colors navy, black, and teal. Navy and black shirts fit great as always and are comfortable to wear when working out or as casual. Though old versions of this shirt seem more durable as this shirt is very thin and light...possibly prone to holes as I read from other reviews. The Teal version of this shirt however has a completely different fit then the other two colors. Very tight almost like spandex and I have never worn anything but large shirts from LuLu. Will be returning the teal but keeping the navy and black. Truly hope the quality of LuLu makes a comeback since how durable and comfortable the clothing always has been is why I don’t mind paying a premium for these clothes. As I read reviews all across the board on many of their new products it doesn’t look good right now. Make LuLu Great Again.",,,0,0

Fits well, breathes well, and performs well. I use this shirt for most everything, including yoga/exercise, casual events, and just a great everyday shirt.

The neck line has started pilling pretty badly, and a small hole has developed in the fabric at the navel. Not sure how the hole got there, but anything is possible. The pilling though is something I would expect with a cheaper, poorer quality shirt, not necessarily one at this price point, and not after such short use. It is not so bad that I can't use the shirt, but now it looks ratty enough that I can only wear it for exercise and would not wear it to social occasions.

Not only was I soaked after the workout (it did not keep my cool during yoga) I had to hang around the yoga studio for a party afterwards with some of the yogis outside.

I have clothes from Old Navy that are a fraction of the price that performed better than this. If I could I would return at least the shirt in a heartbeat but I understand that isnt possible after wearing it. I would really appreciate some feedback and let me know if this is the quality I should expect if I buy any more clothes.","June 21, 2014","Hi kubes9236,

The liner is too tight, too small, and too short.

I tried wearing them a few times to practice to see if I could get used to them, but it is a losing proposition. One cannot partake in yoga with a liner that will not let you move thru your flow. The luxtreme liner is far superior, never a need to adjust during yoga, with ultimate comfort.
Other issues, the side pocket seems smaller, items do not fit comfortably like previous shorts. Also, pocket on liner is difficult to place phone into, not as secure as previous shorts.

I also dislike the new length, it just crops-up too high when doing exercise activities. I don't understand why Lululemon made this update and I would concur with previous reviewers, it was an unnecessary change to a problem it did NOT exist. I have definitely stopped buying these shorts and been looking at other alternatives besides Lululemon.

I am an original Surge Short devotee, I own more than a dozen pairs. Absolutely the best shorts Lulu has ever made. Loved the pocket, the elastic waistband loop is amazing for inversions in practice as well as for hot runs and the fabric has held up over time, so well in fact that many pairs I own look brand new even after 100s of washes. Now, all of that said, I have been very patiently waiting for the release of these shorts. Yes, I own the linerless version, they are nice, as are the shorter lengths, it's just, well, nothing is as good as the original. By now I don't need to explain my excitement when I got my weekly email of new releases and saw my prayers had been answered and my beloved shorts were updated and released! I ordered every color and even in two sizes, just to make sure the fit was right. Well, I eagerly jumped into my fresh shorts for Monday morning practice and only about 20 minutes in I was in agony. The liner of the shorts kept riding up causing a chain reaction that though it's hard to describe here, let's just say that these shorts are ball crushers!I tried everything, pulled liner down over and over, adjusted, tightened and loosened waistband, nothing worked. Frustrated, I went home and examined the shorts to try and identify the source of my, um, discomfort. Don't know what it is exactly, but the liner just doesn't have the appropriate shape/pouch for, well, you know. I have never really experienced this issue and certainly not in the nearly 100 pairs of Lulu bottoms (shorts, trainers, briefs, pants, joggers, Etc). Hoping this is glitch in the newly released design and that future versions will be more, um, ""roomy"". Ever-faithful!","May 17, 2018","Hi FaithfulChiYogi,

However, these are 2 concerns:
1) the sizing seems inconsistent - 2017 models seem to be cut tighter with shorter sleeves. I found out the hard and expensive way. I assumed that the same size from last year would fit so I tore the tags off only to find that the shirt was skin tight. So I had to request an a return (this was an online purchase) but was only able to receive merchandise credit
(which I have yet to receive) and then had to re-purchase in store. The same size purchased in store fit more consistent with other Metal Vents I own.
2) this years Metal Vent doesn't seem as durable. Pulls very easily compared to previous years models.

I was looking for a light weight shirt that feels comfortable and thought I had found the jackpot. It is a pretty simple looking t-shirt that had gone on sale, so I went ahead and purchased it. I didn't think to check out ALL the pictures of the shirt online before purchasing, specifically in the pewter blue color, where you can see how the shirt actually bunches a little funny around the collar bone as well as around the arm pit area in the back. No matter how you adjust the shirt, it doesn't seem to fit right because of the way the shirt is cut. It is even worse when you raise your arm out or up. You can't see it in the photos, but the distance between the sleeve and the arm pit area is very short. When you lift your arm, you lift the entire shirt and even more fabric bunches up on top of the shoulders. Unfortunately, I can't return the shirt since it was on sale. It was really disappointing, and I would not recommend anyone buy this shirt unless you're into the look of fabric bunching up to form weird looking bumps when you wear a t-shirt.","July 4, 2018","Hey daytimeshopper,

I will give it this, the garment is light weight and fabric feels kinda cool, but yet the hood weighs about the times as much as the rest of it so its awkward. The hood drags the garment up you in a weird way and it feels heavy on your back and generally uncomfortable. The collar and zippers are engineered in such a manner that ensures either side is always in the perfect position to drag the zipper clear across your neck. They even reinforced the edges of the to make absolutely certain there is weight to drag this thing uncomfortably on any part of your sweaty neck it can.

He said it was very comfortable, and liked the looser fit. He is also a generally sweaty guy, so having the anti-stink technology is really helpful. He loves this shirt so much that he wears it almost everywhere; to class, working out, walking the dogs, hanging around the house, running errands etc. It is the perfect shirt for spring, summer, and fall. Winter it won't be warm enough here, but I think it would be a good layering piece. The reason that I like this shirt is because it's very flattering on my husband. Specifically the stitching on the upper neck-area of the shirt. Finding a shirt that not only feels good physically, but makes him feel good mentally is a win-win.

Although I agree with the one reviewer that said lulu should have a line of tall products. However this has been one of the best shirts I have ever had. It offers just enough room in the arms and in the torso for me to move comfortably without feeling restricted. Not only does the Large fit well it is also extremely comfortable. It is a completely different feel to Nike or Under Armour products. As well as the fit is completely different.I rowed crew in college and we were an under armor school and Under armour shirts tend the be really tight and short or really short and baggy (Large vs. XL) and lulu shirts do not present that problem.,,,6,0

I have read how fragile the fabric is, so I am always worried I will put a hole in it just from wrestling it on.
I got the women's 2 sizes too big just for the arms to be comfortable. However, the body of the shirt makes me look like a lego guy, round and shapeless, but at least I can put my arms in it without too much of a fight.
I got this shirt because we go mining, and I needed something breathable, easy to take on and off, long sleeved to protect my arms from sun and scrapes, and stink free.
I wore it mining yesterday and I was very comfortable. I could push the sleeves up when I needed to (which I cannot do in the women's), easily put them back down, quickly put my thumbs in the thumbholes and put my gloves back on without a second thought, it was oversized enough that I never felt like my shirt was pulling or I had to adjust it while I'm on the side of a mountain.
As a bonus, when we got off the mountain and were eating dinner at the base, the cooler breeze started to pick up and I was still comfortable.
I like the colors of the women's swiftly, and I will wear it around town, however for function and working, this is the shirt I will be wearing. I only wish men's came in something besides black and grey! Don't men like some color too? I want to be seen when I'm on the side of the hill, not blend in!

It would've been nice for the long paragraph on the receipt to mention that tags are required! I have the original receipt, and the 6-inch-long tag on the collar still attached, it's ridiculous that I can't return a clearly inferior hoodie (by Lulu's standards) simply because I cut the tag off before throwing it in the wash.
