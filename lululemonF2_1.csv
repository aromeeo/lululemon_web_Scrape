However, I just purchased the scarlet pair, and I wore them for the first time this week--and they were awful! The red pair seems to be made out of a completely different fabric that has no stretch AT ALL. I went for a run in them, and the lack of stretch caused them to ride up and get stuck/bunched at the top of the thigh with little to no ability to get them to stay put/stay down. I am so disappointed because the color is beautiful, but they simply are not the same as all the other 4-way stretch speed up shorts I have always bought. Sad to say these will probably waste away in the drawer as they really are unwearable.","July 31, 2018","Dear SadSpeedShortie,

I own several pairs of speed up shorts because of the fun colors and prints, however I have switched to buying the hotty hot shorts because the fit of the speed up shorts is so awkward-the waist is ginormous and I have to use the draw-cord which makes the shorts pucker and poke out awkwardly. I can't wear these with just a sports bra or fitted top without looking ridiculous from the bulging and puckering created from the drawcord. I do not have this issue with the hotty hot shorts both short and long or any of the various tights and crops in the same size. I attempted the high-waisted speed up shorts thinking surely the designer would make the waist smaller but nope those are even worse- the awkward puckering falls exactly at my natural waist making for a superbly unflattering fit. I cant size down because the liner is too small for my booty. I appreciate lined shorts so that is not a complaint I just cant understand why the waist of these shorts (as well as the run times) is so huge in the exact same size as the hotty hot shorts and leggings??? The waist band is stretchy so i really dont get the need to make it bigger than most other bottoms of the same size....The quality is good and material is durable but ugh the awkward fit. If you have a squat booty, muscular thighs and a semi small waist these are probably not for you-go with the hotty hot shorts. For reference I'm 5'6, 130lbs, waist 27 inches, hips 39 inches. Please Lululemon for the love of fat bottomed girls around the world that have small waists update these shorts to have a smaller waist band like the hotty hots!!!","July 20, 2018","Hi rvafitmama,

LET'S GO FOR IT! I've been waiting for a bra like this for awhile now.
As I received it, I tried and it was all true, lock and loaded. I was excited to tried for a workout. I'm a DD and my ribcage is very small, it's hard to find something that fits right so I was super excited when I saw how great this bra hugged me.
Today I finally had a chance to take it to a real try and I was so disappointed.
After the first 15 minutes, I started felling high pressure on my neck, insane pressure, I wanted to get it off immediately but I was driving and I was hoping for this sensation to at least get less...pressuring during the workout. I was wrong. It only got worst so one hour later all I could think of was ""I want to get this off right now.""
During the workout, beside the pain on my neck, everything seemed to be just perfect: I jumped and the girls were not moving, I moved around and all good. Went in dower facing dog and did a reach backs and... ALERT ALERT!!! THE GIRLS ARE COMING OUT!!! YES! As this bra is my perfect fit, it doesn't cover the higher part so when you go ""upside down"" they come out!! I was so embarrassed. No one seemed to noticed what I was going through but my workout was a full struggle having to make sure the girls didn't just show off unrequested. Not fun.
I don't know what I'm gonna do with this bra now.

I've been eyeing it for a while. I bought it in 2 colors and I really thought it would be the perfect bra. I loved the fact that lulu finally decided to do molded cups because no one really wants a uni boob. It is so hard to find a bra that separates and shapes AND supports you during all activities. I'm no stranger to owning several types of bras and leggings for different sports or activities, but wouldn't it be great if there was one bra that could do all and tick off all my needs. I know it is a tall order and a lot to ask. I mean women's bodies are all so different what works for me won't work for you necessarily. With all that said this bra was a total fail for me and let me tell you why. First off I'm usually a size 6 in lulu tops and bras. 36C 34C depending on the bra. I'm petite and have an athletic build and I feel that's important to mention because bra straps tend to be too long for me. I'm in between sizes 6 sometimes is too tight right but going up to an 8 makes it too big. This bra if you look at the photo's has a binding that goes around all the edges. This is an open invitation for back fat or arm pit fat to spill over. The only way to avoid this is by hoping this bra offers a perfect fit and because I am petite and the straps always tend to be too long if I go up in size defeating the purpose of offering support. The binding also is very uncomfortable and offers very little give or stretch making this bra really hard to put on and take off especially if you are sweaty. If you look at the enlite bra there is no binding making that bra seamless under clothing and more comfortable. I also should add that I have wide athletic breast not full breasts so they don't completely fill the cups. This has always been a problem for me as the width of my breast tissue measures a C-D cup but I don't have the fullness of a C-D cup. The struggle to find a perfect sports bra rages on and because I bought it on sale I have to keep it. Seriously though lulu rethink your WMTM return policy. With tags still on and a shorter return time frame or even for an exchange for other product I think you guys should be a little more accommodating. I know I'm not the only one that has been a long time lulu shopper.","July 31, 2018","Dear skinnylittlefatgirl,

The gap is so big it causes the girls to move around a bit during cardio or high-impact workouts. Because there is no way to adjust the bra - if you're like me and fall into this in-between size (too big for a 6, but too small for an 8) you may find this bra isn't quite right.

I am a 36DD and had issues with my old sports bras not having enough support for my girls, and I finally decided to splurge and get one for a steeper price with hopes that it would work better.
Overall, I like this bra. It works well for weight training and biking. I'm not a runner so I can't speak much to that, but on the bike it works great! The rib band it very snug and holds its place so well, sometimes its a bit tricky to get off. Even though the bands are not adjustable they fit my size well, and I have larger shoulders from years of swimming. The padded shoulders are wonderful also.
The fact that it doesn't have annoying inserts is a godsend! The one issue I do experience with this bra is that while it is made for C/D, for DD I find that I am being pushed up top and it creates this small extra layer of boob at the top, if you get what I mean. It's not too bad, I just find myself shoving my boobs back into the bra a few times during my workout so it's not as obvious.

In the winter its fine to have all the hooks and clasps and usual over the shoulder straps, but in the summer want a low profile bra that looks normal under tank tops or on its own. Problem is that those usually give no support or just mash your boobs together into one blob. This bra is almost perfect! The molded cups without inserts, the comfortable straps, tight rib band, minimalist strap design, ALL PERFECT. I especially love the high cut arm holes, too often racerback bras have these low cut arm holes that then pull towards your neck...hello arm pit fat squeezing out and making you look ridiculous. Some people have complained about this, and every body is different, but I love it. Perhaps that is a petite size thing, I usually end up having straps altered to shorten them and bring the bra up. Only thing I would change about this bra is the slightly low cut front. It isn't terrible, but Im not a fan of having any cleavage when I am trying to workout. Why do they always feel the need for that v in the front? Doing dubs, burpees and handstand pushups, I want the girls to stay out of sight. Even a piece of mesh across the top would suffice. When you have boobs this thing doesn't lay flat across your chest plate, its pulled out and I can see all the way down into the depths of my boobs, not necessary. Its like the classic vneck t-shirt, girls with smaller chests can wear them to work and its fine. I look like I am headed out to the club and you can see down to my belly button if you are taller than me, which is pretty much everyone.",,,1,0

First off, when you have big boobs a bra with a back fastener is so helpful, it was a little hard to get it on and off so I can’t imagine what it would be like if I were sweaty. I could have gotten past that though and purchased it except the sides of the bra came up too high and cut into my underarm, it was very uncomfortable because the fabric is very firm and limited my mobility. Now on to the good, my favorite part was the padding , it was permanent (as in no removable cups, yay!) and didn’t give me uniboob, and it was just the right amount, I don’t need a push-up bra to workout, I just need support which this bra gave.

It showed just how much crotch and butt sweat occurs when exercising in 90 degree heat. Could anything make you feel more gross than looking at your crotch and wondering if you actually did pee yourself because surely these shorts wouldn't show THAT much sweat.....(after much deliberation, I decided I did NOT pee myself :)).

I have a 36DD chest and finding a bra that just works has been a serious journey. I tried 7(!) bras before I found this one, and because I’m future stepmom to three kids, I don’t have a ton of running budget and had to order, then return each one online. The UPS guy and I are buddies. This was going to be my holy grail. I bought this at my local store even though it was way out of my original budget, and just jumped around the house marveling at how little my chest moved. Running was a dang joy.
That lasted about 4 weeks. Now, despite following the care instructions to the letter, the chest band on the highest setting (when I bought it I could barely hook the loosest), and trying to run tall with my shoulders pulled back, this bra just isn’t supportive anymore. If it was made of traditional fabric I would have it altered, I just lost about an inch or so in the straps, but that negates a lot of the compression and gives my boobs complete freedom. Running is downright embarrassing again with my chest everywhere. I signed up for my first 10k at the end of this month and I’m not even training as much as I want to because I’m shy about the bounce.

So I was thrilled to see bras with more inclusive sizing in the stores. To date, I've purchased three of these bras to try to give Lululemon a chance and hoping that I was just having ""early adopter issues."" Here are the major issues with this product:
1. The eye-hooks are (very, very) difficult to clasp with the bra on. You will find yourself wanting to clasp the bra before putting it on, which is a problem because of #2...
2. The eye-hooks rip out of the fabric. They appear to be glued in to create a streamlined look but they can pull out of the fabric overtime or with stress.
3. The material that the bra is made out of stretches out over time. At first, the bra will feel very snug and secure and overtime it will be too big.
4. On the styles that have netting/tuille style fabric connecting the cups to the bra, the netting will rip away from the cup.","July 15, 2018","Hey Nursejennyp,

The only downside was the clasp broke on 2 of my bras. I bought one in a size 34C because the salesperson talked me into it. At first, it fit ok, but then it was stretched and buckled in the top chest area. The bras are pricey so would expect higher quality. The 2 clasp broke pretty quickly and the stitching came out.

Enlite Bra,$98.00,,3.5 out of 5,5 out of 5,NICYYC,"CALGARY, AB",RUNNER,25-34,ATHLETIC,,,,The sports bra I've always needed,2018-05-05,"I have been a customer of Lululemon for over 12 years. I have always loved their amazing quality, style, and designs for women's athletic gear. I used it as I have gotten more active over the years for running, hiking, and yoga (both teaching and practicing). A couple of years ago I experienced some body shape changes, and finding a sports bra that fit a larger chest size, but still offered all the support I needed to be able to do high impact/intensity sports, was not easy. I naturally turned to Lululemon and was incredibly disappointed in their selection for women of all different body sizes. The brand was supposed to be founded on inclusivity for all. I wrote to Lululemon about my concerns and disappointment as a member of the then R&D team at their designs for women who needed the extra support. A couple of weeks ago after not having bothered to look for a bra at Lululemon for years, I was pleasantly surprised! This bra was made with women who are bigger chested in mind. It is incredible! Seamless, supportive, smooth, and lightweight. I have tested it while going for runs, high intensity explosive work, and weightlifting, it works for everything. I feel supported, light, and there is absolutely no pinching or cutting into me anywhere. If you are having a hard time finding a sports bra to do all the things you love while still keeping everything comfortable and in place, this is the bra for you!",,,3,0

Not to mention it is incredibly comfortable; soft, stretchy but supportive. I will say though, I was fitted in the store and got a 34 DD (this is my normal size). It was perfect at first, but it quickly stretched out after running it in. I went back to the store and talk to them (they have the BEST customer service) and they told me it stretches a lot- they have learned from the feedback from customers. So I exchanged it for a 32E, which had to be ordered ( it was at my house in 24 hours!) **When I received it, it was SUPER tight. I mean SUPER TIGHT (I could even fasten it)- but just after 1 run, it was perfect! Therefore, make sure this bra is uncomfortable tight when you first get it because it will stretch a lot!",,,3,0

I have only used it three times so far so I'm not sure how it will hold up but my first impression is that is provides excellent support, gives you a really nice shape, is very comfortable and is cute enough to wear on its own (I wear it to spin with no shirt over).

I was wary of the hefty price tag and other reviews saying it would stretch out but so far so good. I run 3-4x per week and yoga every day. As a 34DDD I find it extreeeemely difficult to find good sports bras that hold me in for running. Obviously you'll never be able to completely get rid of bounce, but this bra feels like a cloud and holds me in better than I could hope. I've had it for a few months now and still fits well- although I did buy a 34DD for extra snug-ness. Well worth the investment in my opinion - currently have 2 and will keep an eye on the new colors so I can buy more as they come out!",,,3,0

It's the only bra I feel comfortable running in, and it does a great job of keeping everything in place without digging into my back or shoulders. My only critique would be that now, after running in it 1-2 times a week for 6 months, is that the chest band has stretched out and is a bit loose. This has caused a tiny bit of chafing, but it still does the job. I usually have the hardest time finding running bras, so I am very happy with this product!",,,3,0

I wore it about 5 times and returned it. I was using it for spinning and running and it wasn't doing the trick. There was still a lot of movement and digging into my shoulders.

As a large chested lady, I struggle to find bras that will hold everything in while doing down ward dogs, inversions, or basically doing anything but tree pose.

I bought the first version of this bra when it came out a year ago and was really hopeful. I had myself fitted in store and asked all the right questions- and I took it home and it worked perfectly!

My first one is smooth right across the top but now the new fabric puckers right in middle at the top of the breasts, looks awful w/low cut tops. I went to the Queen St store to buy a new one this weekend and when I questioned it they told me that was the design, bought it, took it home, returned it the next day. It wasn’t just this one, a few clients also encountered the pucker and were told by different stores that this was normal.

I do not wear for running, I feel the support is not there for that level. I do wear it for everything else though. I purchased the 36C, which was very tight for first few wears (I am a 36C/D). I wanted it a bit tight assuming it would stretch. I find it a bit hot in very humid weather. I ended up purchasing in another color as well (on sale).

She recommend that I sized up to a 10 (I'm a 6 in most leggings) since the 8 might ride up more than I'd like. I tried on the 10 and they looked exactly the way I wanted (I like my workout shorts flowy and much more on the loose side - not tight fitting at all) and worked well with my larger quads and glutes, and seemed like they would be great for both runs and workouts. At first I was a bit hesitant about buying them in a larger size, since they didn't fit me well in the waist, but the inner drawstring works well for me and was able to be tightened enough that they fit right. They looked great on, especially with the short inseam (longer shorts tend to make me look a lot larger since I'm on the shorter side) and were super comfy for walking around and the first few workouts I wore them too. However, after I'd bought another 2 pairs of the hottie hot ii and a pair of the hottie hot i I realized how much they rode up not only when I went on long runs but even on short walks to run errands. Because of how much they ride up and how short they are there's very few tops I can wear with them, which is so sad with the high price tag and beautiful colors.

BUT, I am so frustrated with Lululemon, I decided it was time. (This review is for the Hotty Hot short 2.5"" but every time I click the link to leave a review, it takes me to the 4"".) I have been an avid fan of Lululemon for 10 years. I have an entire dresser full of Lululemon leggings and shorts. I have always, always been a size 6 in everything. The last handful of times that have purchased items, leggings and shorts, the sizing has been ridiculously inconsistent (and the material of terrible quality). I purchased these shorts as the Hotty Hot 2.5"" are my favorite and I decided it was time for a couple new pairs. I ordered my normal size 6. They came today, and they are so small I could hardly get them on! I compared them to a pair of Hotty Hot shorts that I have had for a couple years, and they are 2 inches smaller across, the waist is stiff, and the inseam is only 2"" not 2.5"". Honestly, they seem like a size 2, not a size 6. My husband held them up and laughed at how small they are. I bought 2 pairs, they both are like this. I am quite upset as one pair is a Final Sale purchase and cannot be returned. I keep coming back to Lululemon, hoping they have gotten their act together, but they still haven't. Every time I walk in a store and feel the new material, I leave because it's such low quality. Every time I order an item that has always been a favorite style of mine, I have to return it because of sizing and low quality material. I have given you many chances Lululemon, and this is it. I am done. You have lost one of your biggest fans and I will not recommend your brand anymore. Lululemon is not the amazing brand it used to be.",,,0,0

I own quite a few pairs of hotty hot shorts. They are my absolute favorite, the fit, the fabric, every bit of them a win for me at 5’ with a 27” inseam and an athletic curvy build. When I saw these on final sale (2.5” inseam and inkwell color), I had to have them. They arrived yesterday, I tried them on and instant disappointment! The fabric is stiff and VERY cheap feeling, like a poor grade of nylon. The site says 4 way stretch, the tag says 2 way and there was literally not stretch at all. The pleated front seam created a weird off putting puffy bulge. But since these were final sale, I am stuck with them. My second pair is due to arrive today, hopefully they are not equally disappointing. I will not be buying online from Lululemon anymore, the inconsistency in sizing and quality as well as having to travel over an hour to make a return only to deal with rude employees is not worth the trouble.

When I went to the store they would not let me exchange them, instead offered to sew them stating it would be ""a small stich"". I got these shorts back in the promised timeline however the quality of the sewing was terrible, it looked like a 6th grader fixed these as a home ec project.

I was looking for either a front zip or back closure bra that I could run in and would keep the girls down. I was recently measured by a professional so I knew my size, a 32E and this was the bra that came recommended. I was told it was true to size, so I ordered my usual size 32E since this isn't carried in the store. Fast forward, it arrives yesterday and I am like a kid on Christmas morning! Finally a run where my boobs won't threaten me that they are going to pop out of my bra mid run.... Well.... I go to put on the bra and its extremely tight- good sign, until I look in the mirror and my boobs are touching my chin almost. I cram them in there and take off for my run.... half way through I look down and was so bummed the bra created amazing cleavage but did not keep my ladies secure. Such a bummed, had to stop mid run and actually walk back home and change bras to finish up. Can y'all PLEASE make a bra for someone that is larger than a C cup?? And one that unhooks either in the front or back? It is extremely hard to remove a 32 band over your head after a 2 hour run in 90% humidity, Enlite Bra I am talking to you.","May 17, 2018","Hi ChristinMary,

And despite the great reviews, I would argue that this bra is NOT for high performance activities as advertised. In fact, multiple times during my spin class I felt like my boobs were going to spill out onto the bike. Talk about distracting….
My bra size is a 34C and I would say that the sizing on this bra is smaller than most. The straps really dig into your back and the fabric feels somewhat cheap/itchy. I almost feel like I sweat more because of the poor quality of the fabric. Very disappointed with both the structure and the material.
The low cut structure will not keep your ladies in and is not friendly if you’re slightly lopsided in that department. It also begins to unravel in the wash. The quality of lululemon products has certainly be on the decline.
If I had to choose between this and the Enlite Bra, I’d say go with the Enlite.","March 20, 2018","Hey MichelleJast,

She recommend that I sized up to a 10 (I'm a 6 in most leggings) since the 8 might ride up more than I'd like. I tried on the 10 and they looked exactly the way I wanted (I like my workout shorts flowy and much more on the loose side - not tight fitting at all) and worked well with my larger quads and glutes, and seemed like they would be great for both runs and workouts. At first I was a bit hesitant about buying them in a larger size, since they didn't fit me well in the waist, but the inner drawstring works well for me and was able to be tightened enough that they fit right. They looked great on, especially with the short inseam (longer shorts tend to make me look a lot larger since I'm on the shorter side) and were super comfy for walking around and the first few workouts I wore them too. However, after I'd bought another 2 pairs of the hottie hot ii and a pair of the hottie hot i I realized how much they rode up not only when I went on long runs but even on short walks to run errands. Because of how much they ride up and how short they are there's very few tops I can wear with them, which is so sad with the high price tag and beautiful colors. As I've worn and washed the shorts more it's only gotten worse, and they often cause chafing (something I've never had to deal with before) when I wear them on longer runs. I wish I would have known that they would do that before I bought so many pairs, that I can almost only wear for lounging around my house.","July 31, 2018","Dear ecd13,

BUT, I am so frustrated with Lululemon, I decided it was time. (This review is for the Hotty Hot short 2.5"" but every time I click the link to leave a review, it takes me to the 4"".) I have been an avid fan of Lululemon for 10 years. I have an entire dresser full of Lululemon leggings and shorts. I have always, always been a size 6 in everything. The last handful of times that have purchased items, leggings and shorts, the sizing has been ridiculously inconsistent (and the material of terrible quality). I purchased these shorts as the Hotty Hot 2.5"" are my favorite and I decided it was time for a couple new pairs. I ordered my normal size 6. They came today, and they are so small I could hardly get them on! I compared them to a pair of Hotty Hot shorts that I have had for a couple years, and they are 2 inches smaller across, the waist is stiff, and the inseam is only 2"" not 2.5"". Honestly, they seem like a size 2, not a size 6. My husband held them up and laughed at how small they are. I bought 2 pairs, they both are like this. I am quite upset as one pair is a Final Sale purchase and cannot be returned. I keep coming back to Lululemon, hoping they have gotten their act together, but they still haven't. Every time I walk in a store and feel the new material, I leave because it's such low quality. Every time I order an item that has always been a favorite style of mine, I have to return it because of sizing and low quality material. I have given you many chances Lululemon, and this is it.

I love Lululemon, but I am just very disappointed that I spent all this money and they are not wearable. I don't have the tags anymore so I can't even return them. The design is very very nice but I guess I just got unlucky with a bad pair.","July 24, 2018","Dear Macey,

Over the past year it feels like their quality and customer service has declined which was VERY obvious when it came to these shorts. I bought these shorts about 2 weeks ago and the first time I wore them they got caught on my round, not sharp, kitchen cabinet knob and immediately ripped (it was not a hard pull by any means). When I went to the store they would not let me exchange them, instead offered to sew them stating it would be ""a small stich"". I got these shorts back in the promised timeline however the quality of the sewing was terrible, it looked like a 6th grader fixed these as a home ec project. The stitching is unnecessarily large and just sloppy, I would rather have a hole in my pants than this. Overall, for $60 i would expect more durable fabric and at the very least a skilled professional sewing my shorts.","June 15, 2018","Good day Anna1989,

I'm confused as I thought Lululemon really focussed on fabrics that won't leave sweat stains, or stink as much post workout.

I have at least 30 pairs of LLL tights/crops, and the Speed Up Crops are the ONLY pants that don't chafe me over longer distances. I live in SoCal so I can typically race in shorts and avoid this issue but I ran the Boston Marathon last week in these crops because the weather was cold, windy and wet and there was no chafing or sliding. I have 3 pairs of these crops and they all fit me the same (for reference, I'm 5'4"" / 105# and wear my usual LLL size 2); that said, I think they may be a little more snug than most of my other pants but I suspect that's why they stay put and don't chafe me. I trained in these tights all winter and logged hundreds of miles in them and I haven't experienced the stretched-out feeling that other reviewers have mentioned. I love all of the pockets on these crops for my gels, salt tabs, etc. and specifically the position of the thigh pockets which keep things at my finger tips. I also like the slightly thicker weight of this material over regular Luxtreme because if it's cold enough to wear pants then I want them to keep me warm. One nit, LLL: please don't print dark patterns on white inside fabric - it distorts the pattern when it's stretched and looks really bad.

I probably could have gone up to a 10. The problem is that the bra itself was tight but the bottom band does not sit flat. I attribute this to not having enough fabric or some design flaw, which made my bewbs start coming out the bottom of this bra. I was so sad! Its a gorgeous design but not functional for my size. I'm going to return it for the free to be serene bra which is stellar.",,,3,4

This was not that big of an issue because I know that the two different pants have different purposes. So, I bought these and I only have a few complaints. First of all, the waist length is rather awkward, it's not long enough to pull up comfortably over my stomach while sitting and for a couple times when I had walked for a while, I have noticed chaffing. This was not that big of a deal, because I usually do not walk as much as I did those few times. I usually wear these pants to school, not preferably to lounge in, because of the stiff material and the uncomfortable wait band.

I haven't had any issue with the stitches popping/unraveling or anything of the sort. I am usually either a size 4 or 6 in leggings depending on the material, and I decided to go with the 6 in these because they were more comfortable when trying them on (also shoutout to the ladies that work at Lulu because they are always the most helpful and nice people out there, if you ever have a question about fit and are shopping alone, try the item on and ask them what they think!)
Recently, about a month or two ago, I went back and bought these tights in the black, and although the material has been changed slightly, I still love them just as much as the grey pair I have.
I wear these leggings at least 3 times a week each, to the gym/casual outings/etc. I weight lift, do HIIT, and stretch all week in these and they still hold up (no pilling, ripping, or unraveled stitches to complain about here) and still look brand new!

They don't move as freely and the front fabric rolls up on the bottom of the leg. I think it is part because the waist is wider, it cuts into the fabric above the legs too much.

I got my usual size, and they felt slightly tighter than normal, but the next size up was too loose. At home, I even compared them to the original Run Times Short that I had, to see if the inseam was shorter. It didn't visually appear to be shorter, so I figured I'd give these a try. I couldn't even walk around the grocery store without the shorts riding up in the front and bunching. An attempted 3 mile run was an utter disaster - I kept having to tug on them, and felt like there was NO back coverage. I finally pulled them down, in an effort to keep them from riding up, but then it felt like the shorts were going to fall off. As far as quality goes - the fabric feels like it's thinner than the original, so I'm not sure how durable, resistant to pilling, etc. these shorts would be in. Incredibly disappointed and frustrated.
I'm disappointed and ready to move on from Lululemon - every item I've looked at it seems has nothing but negative reviews, and a return policy of NOT being able to try out gear means I'm left with an expensive pair of shorts that aren't even good to run errands in. It's impossible to tell in a changing room if an article of clothing is going to work over a multi-mile run; I'm in need of new sports bras and am now hesitant to try anything that Lulu has to offer given the price point and return policy.
If Lululemon were to bring back the original version, I'd buy 10 pairs without thinking about it.","August 1, 2018","Hi FromOHtoVARunner,

I ordered these in the Zen Garden color in a 4 and figured I was safe despite the fact some of the reviews here say they run small, since the reviews for the Speed Up Crops also said they ran small. While the waist on these is fine, WOW, are these tight on my legs! I can't wear these at all. If I walk five steps, they ride up and stay like a pair of bikini underwear. They also don't look like a 4"" inseam...they look a lot shorter than on the model. I even checked the tag because I was certain I'd been sent a pair that are 2.5"".

I ordered two new RT II shorts, and I measured them against two of my old pairs of RT shorts so I could be accurate in my review, and guys, they are exactly the same size. Exactly. Waist band, length, inseam, pocket size, literally everything is identical except for one measurement: the width across the middle of the bum/hips is about 3/4"" wider on the RT II (size 6). This works fine for my body, and I imagine it would work well for most of us who have some runner bum muscle.

They're my absolutely favorite pair of lulu shorts. I went to the store to get another pair and they only had the Run Times II. The store associate told me ""they didn't change much"" so I bought them without trying them on. When I put them on at home they feel like a completely different short!! They're SO tight in the waist and hips and are extremely unflattering. I'll be returning them to get the original Run Times short.",,,0,0

Why mess with a short with such a high rating? My first running shorts with LLL were the Groovy Run Shorts but sadly they were discontinued so when they brought out the Run Times I started wearing those and have been wearing them ever since. I tried on the new version and am not pleased at all with the changes. I don't like the new Swift Ultra Light fabric as much as the Swift Ultra and the fit is ruined with a tighter waist band and narrower leg opening that along with the change in fabric pulls the fabric across the crotch area making for an unflattering look. The second you lift your leg to take a step the shorts ride up making them look shorter. If I wanted a shorter inseam I would buy the Speeds but I want a 4"" inseam short that looks like a 4"" inseam. The changes are subtle but make a huge difference in how they look and fit which is why I won't be buying them along with the Dance Studio Pant and Street To Studio Pants which were changed as well. I am not a happy customer with these changes.",,,0,0

I needed more shorts and bought some at my store in my usual size 6 not noticing these were Run Times II shorts. Like other reviewers I wondered if I grabbed the wrong size or if I accidentally bought the speed shorts. Nope! Luckily when I got home and took them out of the bag I thought they looked a bit smaller so I tried them on. Back to the store they went. Not only do they run a size smaller but they are indeed shorter in length. I have very long legs and can't spare any length as it is. There are so many short shorts for all the awesome ladies who wear them but that's not for me. Luckily I found some Run Times originals in a 6 at the store in a less cool color and did an exchange. Sad because I'll have to figure something else out for shorts in the future.,,,0,0

I have several pairs, I work out most days, and it is a no-brainer for me to replace my worn Run Times with fresh prints and patterns as Lulu releases them. That said, I really hope the Run Times II are not replacing the regular Run Times. Two pairs arrived this week. I put one pair on yesterday and wore them to my gym class. I thought they felt a little snugger or shorter. Today, I put on the second pair...then I took them off and measured them. They are a skimpier short. The inseam is 3 1/2 to 3 3/4 inches. Frankly, there are plenty of short-shorts at Lululemon already --- please do not mess with a good thing. I want a 4 inch inseam for spin and weight training and running, etc., and if you can't get this right, I will reluctantly look elsewhere.",,,0,0

They have been the near perfect running and work-out shorts for me for many years now and are one of my favorite Lululemon pieces. I was interested in trying the Run Times Short II to see if the updates made a fantastic short even better. Sadly, the updates don't work for me. The fabric is a stiffer, stretchier Swift Ultra Light (vs the silkier, lighter Swift Ultra in the originals). The updated fabric may be fine for a vest but does not work on these shorts as it doesn't lay nicely (it pulls, wrinkles, and puckers) and the legs stick out on the sides in an unflattering way due to the stiffer fabric (you can see this a little on the model online wearing the amalfi blue shorts). The fit is true to size but is not the same as the originals. PLEASE do not discontinue the original Run Times Short in the Swift Ultra fabric, Lululemon. I like a great gear update but please reassess the updates to these shorts before discontinuing an awesome product. The current updates make the new version unwearable for me.",,,0,0

They've got a perfect high waist and 7/8 length with the best pockets for all your necessities for a long run.
But ohhhhh my goodness the sweat that shows on these babies is incredible. I first purchased a black pair as I made my venture back in to the running world. I instantly fell in love and decided another pair would be great to alternate with my newly coveted basic blacks - even though I did notice some fraying with the stitching within the first couple wears and first wash. (to be honest, it wasn't a HUGE deal since they were so comfortable and prevented any discomfort or chafing while running longer distances)
I requested a second pair as a gift and was lucky enough to receive a beautiful teal colour. I continued to use my black pair and decided to save the new teal ones for an upcoming race.
I did one of my tapered runs pre-race and wore my race outfit just to make sure everything was comfortable and was shocked to find an incredibly noticeable ""she pee'd her pants"" sweat mark after 20 mins in to my run.
I know I am one to sweat when I work hard - but most times would like for it to be a little more discreet than it was with these tights.
In true lululemon form, customer service was incredible as always and offered to return my tights. I am hoping to purchase a similar pair... in a darker colour!

I loved everything about these leggings for the first 3 wears, after that not only did they pill along the stitching (this has never happened with any other lulu product i have) but they began to fit lose and the fabric began to feel cheap. I loved these leggings when i first purchased them but these are not the leggings i first purchased. If anything they feel cheap which for being so expensive doesn't make sense to me. They also pull/snag wayyyyy too easily which has also never happened to me before. I purchased a white pair similar to these with similar fabric from lululemon as well and they also pilled along the stitching. I am following drying and washing instructions so I'm extremely confused why this is happening. I also would've purchased these a size smaller had i known they were going to stretch. I have worn many pairs of my lulus many times before washing and this has never happened so I don't know whats going on with these new styles. Disappointed, don't suggest purchasing these unless some how they have improved them in the past 2 months.","April 30, 2018","Hi pilatesinstructor20,

I must say, I was a bit disappointed with this shirt. I do care for my sleeves to be longer, but the length of the sleeves on this shirt was a bit excessive. Also, the thumb holes are a great addition; but, the fabric surrounding the thumb holes extends too far up the sleeve for my comfort. Though the description as well as the reviews did specify that the fit would be fairly snug, I was not expecting the extent to which it hugged my body, most specifically my armpits. The fabric did not cause chafing as I feared, but nonetheless it was a bit too tight for my personal preference. Lastly, to my utter disappointment, the fabric easily pulls. Should you live near a store, associates are very willing to work with. As I live a few hours from the nearest retailer, it is quite frustrating. Beyond the negatives, though, this shirt is functional for its specified activity, and the length is nice. Next time, I may try the looser fit.","April 3, 2018","Hi jilliann,

When working out you forget about it for the most part. I have an athletic build, with a smaller waist and broad shoulders and bigger thighs. I am a 4 in pants, so sized up as recommended and got a 6 in this shirt. It fits in the stomach but is not made for women with developed lats or delts (the upper arm and armpits are super tight). Super expensive for a not comfortable shirt, and I wish the sleeves had more give because even though its scratchy it wicks sweat really well.",,,5,2

I continue to love the pants and tanks and shorts. I gave this swiftly tech long sleeve a chance - bought it full price about a couple months ago and have worn it 4 times. Wash it on cold, delicate, and air dry. Tonight as I laid it out to air dry, I discovered the seam on the sleeve completely torn apart. I am SO bummed. Not only for the disappointing quality (especially for the price!!!) but also because I was really grateful to have a technical long sleeve shirt for my outdoor pursuits in the winter months.

I decided on the trackers for the extra room for my quads. I have only worn these shorts maybe 5 times and they have only been washed twice in cold water on a delicate cycle and then laid out to dry. Already on the upper portion of the shorts they look extremely worn as if I rubbed them on the cement. Its not from sitting down on a rough surface or anything like that, the effected area is too high up on shorts. I am extremely disappointed in the quality of these shorts especially because I've always heard good things about lululemon. When you pay $60 for a pair of shorts I expected these to last a few years not only 5 uses. After this experience I'm extremely skeptical in purchasing anything else from lululemon if the quality wont withstand with the price you pay.","June 19, 2018","Hey Madyharper,

Only one complaint: it keeps riding up on my knees. As a result, it's pretty much impossible to run in them because it's bothering me a lot. I keep pulling them down, but they go straight back up almost instantly. Also, I'm not that tall - only 5'4 - that's why I'm not sure why it's happening to me. I'm very upset, because I spent 118$ on pair of leggings I thought I will be using for years; however, they will be donated most likely after just wearing them a handful of times.

I keep double checking the date I bought them in disbelief that it hasn't even been a year. I go on long runs twice a week and only use this pair for those - the light weight feel is admittedly AMAZING and I can put my phone in to my pocket during the run and the pants never ever sag.
That being said, I did notice that the bottoms of the pants do roll up relentlessly (as others have stated in their reviews) but I was willing to pretend that wasn't happening just because I loved the fit so much!
But less than a year later a hole has worn in the pocket that I keep my phone and worse - a hole has split in the seam of the thigh big enough for me to not be able to wear them running now.
I take great care of my exercise clothing - I have victorias secret leggings that I've owned/worked out in for YEARS with no holes in them. I much preferred the fit and (what I thought was) quality of the lulus but the hole in the thigh has rendered them unusable.
This was my first pair of lulus and needless to say I'm pretty bummed by how much I spent on them and the fact that less than a year later I can no longer wear them out. :(","July 19, 2018","Dear JessicaGomes,

I'm not sure if they changed the design or what, but I tried on the same pant in store recently and the length seemed a bit longer where they wouldn't roll up. Regardless, the ones I have are not something I would recommend others to buy. The middle seam of the pant is fraying a bit too and I've only had them a few months. I make sure not to dry any lululemon clothes either, so I know that is not the issue. Overall disappointed with the quality. Love lululemon, but this is my first dissatisfied purchase.","June 30, 2018","Dear YogiLove4lulu,

I frequently do weight training, spinning, and the rowing machine, and I found that these tights have been absolutely perfect for everything I do.
I understand the issue with the bottom riding up into my knees, but I find I only have to pull them down once at the start and then when I have a bit of a sweat going on they don't budge too much.
The fabric is lovely and the black colour doesn't show sweat too much, and even after a few washes I don't find that they're stretching or having issues in the wash, but if the waist ever does loosen that's where the drawcord will come in handy. The high rise at the front, and especially the back, keeps me worry free at the gym, especially when I'm wearing a sports bra or a cropped top.
On top of it all, the side pockets are fantastic, I have a bigger phone and the tights don't move at all when my phone is there. They don't roll at my waist either, even when I'm doing abs or bending over. Best of all, I don't feel insecure in them, and they make me feel good in my body.

These were my first purchase from Lulu in a very long time as I am fairly hesitant to spend so much money on clothing for myself with 2 young kids now. Anyway, they felt so great on and the leg pockets are perfect for when I'm using the baby carrier and can't access other pockets in jackets or on the waist. The first time wearing them I was quite happy, but since then I have been less and less happy with them. I should have read other reviews first about the legs riding up to the knees. This happens every single time I wear them, and often after just a short time. I'm not even running or working out, just walking and around the house. Plus I feel like the shape loosens as the day goes on and they almost feel too big by the end of the day. I've never had that happen with other crops or leggings I've worn, most of which are much less expensive.

I really wanted them to be great, not only because they're comfortable but because they're expensive. But I wish I would have thought to read the reviews before I purchased because then I would have gone home with a different pant.
This comfortable fabric shows sweat, which sucks but really is fine because we shouldn't be too ashamed about sweat showing. People sweat. But these pants don't just show sweat- the sweat dries and it shows dried sweat stains. That's terrible.
And I should have known better that the unseamed hem would ride up but a very nice and attentive sales rep assured me that the pants would not ride up around the knee. They did. A lot. Granted if she's only wearing them around the store, and not working out, she may have not experienced that.
The last annoying thing is that everything I put into the back, non zippered pocket, got pushed out. This could be from my big booty or could be from my spibelt pushing it up but I've never had this problem with any other pant.

I was super excited to find them online in my size in the Moroccan blue color. I wanted to love these pants but I went for a run in them the day after they arrived and they CONSTANTLY rode up my calves. It was annoying because as they rode up they would bunch at the bottom of my knees and I had to constantly stop running and pull them down. I wore them to barre class yesterday morning and the same exact thing happened. I kept pulling the legs down in between positions. :( Additionally, at the end of my barre class I looked in the mirror and I had HUGE sweat marks in the the front in my crotch area and in the back all down the middle of my butt. I was embarrassed and I felt like I had to go straight home after my barre class. The lighting at my yoga studio is also much better than the Lulu store…ladies, beware, these pants are not forgiving, at least in the Moroccan blue color. Along with the sweat, I could see every imperfection in the mirror at my yoga studio. These pants also seem to run a little big and stretched out slightly. For reference I am 5'3"" and 130 pounds with a petite curvy athletic build and a size 4 fits me well. These pants will be fine for casual wear around my house or a walk at the park, but unfortunately NOT for going out in public and using them for the reasons I purchased (running, HIIT and barre).

The side pockets work very well for keeping my phone in place and the little pockets on the waistband worked very well for storing my keys and iPod.

They are SO flattering and the compression and stitching slims out your legs like no other leggings I've owned. They make your legs look incredible. The scalloped hem and reflective dots at the bottom add so much style and I always get compliments when I wear these. I wouldn't size up in these, they are quite tight but that's the point of them.
These would be perfect, however:

-I wish they had a higher rise. Personal preference, I just prefer the higher rise of my other pants like Train Times and Wunder Unders.

I always hand wash my lulu clothing with a little bit of detergent but for some reason all of the sudden the green dye comes out of the pants. Every single time! They get lighter and lighter. I basically cry when I see the sight of it :( because they were expensive. Also, the stitching/seams on the side becomes very static like unraveling on the sides and in the inner thigh. When I took them back to the store in Carlsbad where I got them, they just offered to replace it with another pair of leggings but by that time that style was no longer there.

For instance, the beloved CRB. This is my go-to and I have dozens. Everything I loved about the original CRB has been ""fixed"" with the CRB II. This is a shorter, higher-neck version of the classic. If you have a longer torso, this is going to be hard to layer, which is my favorite feature of the original. I really dislike boob sweat and feel like the original kept it at bay by letting the girls breathe a little more with it's lower cut. Take note: SIZE RUNS SMALLER! I'm a solid 4 and could size down to a 2 in the old version. Now I have purchased 4s and 6s in the new version. If you buy TTS you may have a hard time getting a substantial bra underneath.
Enough complaining. Here's the good stuff: The fit is snugger but it also makes me feel more supported. I'm an A cup and can wear this without a bra. The higher neck does make it better for running and the length is nice for Barre and ballet, where I don't want much thigh covered and want more range of motion in my hip flexors.

I will always remember my first purchases and thinking they were expensive but they fit and lasted so they were worth it. Now all I see is corner cutting.

I wear my tanks for the gym and cycling and have never had a problem with the tank staying in the right place. When I run or cycle in this tank it starts riding up my back. The material is awkward and feel likes it doesn't breathe. Also, it is already starting to fall apart. I keep reading the reviews on this site and it seems like the quality is no longer justifying the price. I have to drive over an hour to buy my lulu to check fitting (something I never had to do before bc the sizing was consistent) and then having to go back for repairs or exchanges (if they have your size and colour left) is absolutely annoying. The luon cool racerback used to sell for $38/39.00 now over $50. and for less quality????
