I was looking forward to this warm spring run. This thing destroyed the run. It annoyed me to the ends of the earth. Its like it is engineering from the ground up to annoy its unfortunate wearer. I will give it this, the garment is light weight and fabric feels kinda cool, but yet the hood weighs about the times as much as the rest of it so its awkward. The hood drags the garment up you in a weird way and it feels heavy on your back and generally uncomfortable. The collar and zippers are engineered in such a manner that ensures either side is always in the perfect position to drag the zipper clear across your neck. They even reinforced the edges of the to make absolutely certain there is weight to drag this thing uncomfortably on any part of your sweaty neck it can. My neck is raw from the zipper dragging on my run. If this was the only thing I owned from Lululemon, I would probably never return. Its that awful. Blew $100 on something I am never....

Or definitely going to the store before purchasing. Most of the time I'm in love with lululemon's products because they are not an expensive brand that does not have results. They really put out quality products definitely worth the money. However with this short, I found that the inner liner and the shorts in general start to get extremely uncomfortable on my inner thigh after just a bit of leisurely activity much less running and tend to ride up making it that much more uncomfortable. As someone who wears lululemon shorts and spends a good amount of money on these products. I was pretty disappointed with this product and pretty much just wear them around the house when I run out of my other quality shorts. I'm not sure if the sizing changes for each type of shorts or pants, but I would say try on the pants if they don't have your size in the shorts you want in store.",,,0,1

I did some research, and thought this would be a great first piece for him, especially being on mark down. In store I found the grey color. He tried it on, and loved it. He said it was very comfortable, and liked the looser fit. He is also a generally sweaty guy, so having the anti-stink technology is really helpful. He loves this shirt so much that he wears it almost everywhere; to class, working out, walking the dogs, hanging around the house, running errands etc. It is the perfect shirt for spring, summer, and fall. Winter it won't be warm enough here, but I think it would be a good layering piece. The reason that I like this shirt is because it's very flattering on my husband. Specifically the stitching on the upper neck-area of the shirt. Finding a shirt that not only feels good physically, but makes him feel good mentally is a win-win.

I have read how fragile the fabric is, so I am always worried I will put a hole in it just from wrestling it on.
I got the women's 2 sizes too big just for the arms to be comfortable. However, the body of the shirt makes me look like a lego guy, round and shapeless, but at least I can put my arms in it without too much of a fight.
I got this shirt because we go mining, and I needed something breathable, easy to take on and off, long sleeved to protect my arms from sun and scrapes, and stink free.
I wore it mining yesterday and I was very comfortable. I could push the sleeves up when I needed to (which I cannot do in the women's), easily put them back down, quickly put my thumbs in the thumbholes and put my gloves back on without a second thought, it was oversized enough that I never felt like my shirt was pulling or I had to adjust it while I'm on the side of a mountain.
As a bonus, when we got off the mountain and were eating dinner at the base, the cooler breeze started to pick up and I was still comfortable.
I like the colors of the women's swiftly, and I will wear it around town, however for function and working, this is the shirt I will be wearing. I only wish men's came in something besides black and grey! Don't men like some color too? I want to be seen when I'm on the side of the hill, not blend in!

Here's an idea- don't put your thumbs in them if you don't like them. I bought this shirt specifically because it HAS thumb holes. When I run, I hate how my UA long sleeve shirts ""ride up"" your arm while moving. I constantly have to adjust them. This shirt? It just stays perfectly in place because of the thumb holes. When I don't want the sleeve covering my hand? Wait for it.... I take my thumbs out and they're like normal sleeves! Wow! If you want to nitpick so badly over thumb holes, pretty sure the Conduct doesn't have them, and it's more or less the same shirt. Now if only there were some more solid color options...",,,5,2

This year he asked me to pick up some more because he wears them so much but Lululemon added thumbholes so it so I picked him up one to see if the thumbholes bothered him. When he received the shirt he tried it on and told me to return it because he's never going to wear a shirt with thumbholes.

Ridiculous that a shirt of this 'material' and price is already losing its shape while my target shirts retain shape after 3 years. Last top I buy from lululemon after seeing consistent reviews describing similar problems.",29-Jul-17,"Hey SummerDaze,

While I enjoy lounging around my house on Saturdays in my non-wool metal tech, the wooly metal tech is an improved shirt for winter activities. The wool adds just a bit of heat but not so much to be uncomfortable. I liked it so much, I bought a second so I could rest shirts in between ski days. Also great for days when the house can't seem to get warmed up.",,,0,0

The fabric is soft and seems as though it would be warmer than the standard metal vent tech shirts, but I haven't been able to wear it because the sizing is quite small. I (incorrectly) assumed it would fit similarly to the regular metal vent tech shirts, but it's much tighter than I expected. I want to love this shirt, but it's too tight to be comfortable. Thus, I'm forced to return it. ... otherwise, if the sizing were correct, I'd happily give it a five-star review.",,,0,0
