What I found ironic is that Lululemon prides themselves on ""anti-stink"" material. Even after following all of the care label instructions and washing them immediately after working out, they still permanently smell after a while. I would also like to note that it's not the average semi sweaty, getting stuff done at the gym smell. No, it is a noticeable odor that makes me hesitant to wear them to and from. I have tried everything to get it out, too.

I have at least 10 shorts and one by one, it is slowly happening again. Lululemon does not provide repairs to inner liners anymore, which is very disappointing seeing how the quality of the liners has been extremely poor for years now and I am sure they know seeing the plethora of feedback on such. At the very least, provide liners at cheap cost for replacement. I would've been ok with that but we are forced to spend >$68 for new pairs now.

I totally get that on average, most men prefer plain and basic colors and patterns, but some, like me, have a preference for the creative looks.

That allows me to secure something if I need it secured during periods of high movement, (ID, Keys, Credit Card) or if I am not worried about any of those things falling out (during periods of low movement) then I can keep my items in the regular pockets where they are easier to access. The shorts slide on and off easily, but maintain their grip on my hips when I am sweaty and performing rigorous exercise.

Some great (I have chased a pair of pants to a store 3 states away), some disappoint; but this thing is absolutely horrible. I used it for a run when the weather finally got warmer. I was looking forward to this warm spring run. This thing destroyed the run. It annoyed me to the ends of the earth. Its like it is engineering from the ground up to annoy its unfortunate wearer. I will give it this, the garment is light weight and fabric feels kinda cool, but yet the hood weighs about the times as much as the rest of it so its awkward. The hood drags the garment up you in a weird way and it feels heavy on your back and generally uncomfortable. The collar and zippers are engineered in such a manner that ensures either side is always in the perfect position to drag the zipper clear across your neck. They even reinforced the edges of the to make absolutely certain there is weight to drag this thing uncomfortably on any part of your sweaty neck it can. My neck is raw from the zipper dragging on my run. If this was the only thing I owned from Lululemon, I would probably never return. Its that awful. Blew $100 on something I am never....

There's nothing like living life with clothes that squeeze you into feeling like you're still in your mother's womb. Anyway, about the headband. It has always been my dream to have a man bun, but let me tell you, it has been one awkward journey. I have this medium length hair that's too short to be tied and too long to be quaffed backed, I look like one of those trolls dolls. Hence the use of headbands. I've been using bandana's but they get drenched in sweat and I wanted to treat myself, as a way of self-congratulating for being one step closer to my dream. So I purchased this lululemon headband. At first it fit fine, sure it was a tad loose. But as I workout and get down and dirty, the headband seems to shift a bit. My hair gathers it's strength and decides to unleash itself and the headband slips right off. I wonder if my head is just a weird shape or if my hair is truly that powerful. I like the product, but it just doesnt fit well. Maybe on your own man bun journey this may be a great addition.

I'm assuming the fabric for the inaccessible fly is just for looks, for those that feel conscientious wearing running shorts in public places after a run...not me. My two biggest rubs with the shorts is 1) the overall cut of the shorts and 2) the liner width. The cut is a shade on the snug side, given the 3'' length. This could be easily remedied by going to a split design, 1.5 or 2'' in length, or just decreasing the overall length to 2.5'' length.

I am a size 10.5 in shoes, which according to the website sizing chart, makes me a L/XL in socks. By the look of the socks in the store, the L/XL appeared too big, so I went with a M/L. After trying these on, I returned them as they were too tight in the toes. I wasn't too disappointed as the sizing chart said I would be the larger size; so, exchanged that pair in the store for a L/XL. After trying on those, they were way too big, and would either have to be pulled up so high that they looked goofy, and the heel would be out of place, or they would be bunched up under the middle of my foot. Neither of those options seemed appealing, so I returned those as well. I even tried other styles of socks from Lululemon, and had the same sizing problem. I was disappointed that I could not find a size that worked for me as the socks were very soft and looked to be of high quality.",12-Oct-17,"Hi jmd13818,

After the second time washing it however (in a washer I have washed all of my lulu clothing in) I noticed extreme pitting and decrease in the fabric. The material seemed to deteriorate exceptionally fast. What made it even worse is that I called a month and a half after this issue in regards to the return policy and was told no returns after the first month.

First of all, these are a good length for regular training, I run about 35-45 mpw and these are a cooler design (temperature wise). Now the bad news. The placement of the pocket is on the side, so if you place your keys in the key pocket, it is constantly rubbing during a run. Nike and most other manufacturers place this on the backside so there's no rubbing. First problem is that you feel the key the entire run. Secondly, this wears through the material. The liner is also not the most comfortable out there.
For the money, you can get 2-3 pairs of Nike or UA shorts for the same price and probably 70% of the comfort with more longevity. Sad, as I really wanted to like these shorts.",,,0,0

3. The drawstring, if you can call it that, does not do what it is intended to do, i.e. to tighten your shorts. The design that they use is flawed.
4. The ""shirt holder"" strap in the back of the shorts fails. If your shirt is soaked, it almost pulls your shorts down. If your shirt is dry, the bouncing from running will cause your shirt to eventually fall out.

Initial thoughts: great fit, comfortable, super light, and looked great. I had high expectations of Lululemon, based off other customers holding them in high regard and the high price point. I'm an avid gym goer. Expectations were met until the first time I was them. Keep in mind, I wash everything on a gentle cycle with warm water. I've never ruined any of my clothes. After I washed both shorts I knew there was an issue. The bottom third of the shorts were stretched and were permanently wrinkled. I tried to steam the wrinkles out with no luck. Both shorts exhibited this. Now the shorts are stretched and look disgusting with the permanent wrinkles (almost look like ruffles). I attribute this to the thin fabric not being able to hold it's formed integrity. Needless to say, I wasted $140 on two pairs of shorts that don't fit well and embarrassing to wear. I expected much more from my first pieces of Lululemon clothing. The closest B&M store is 2 hours away so I didn't have a chance to try to return them.

For the price, one would expect a form-fitting pair of gym shorts and I would not purchase again.",,,0,0

These are hands down the best shorts that Lulu makes. My only complaint about the other pacebreaker shorts that I've been wearing for years was the liner. The seam down the middle of the front in the liner of the others was ungodly huge and chafed me like crazy in the most sensitive of areas, so I had to start cutting out the liners so I could wear underwear underneath. Lo and behold, Lulu answered my prayers and came out with these. They're perfect for pretty much any activity. They're a great length - not too short and not too long - and they are very lightweight and comfortable. Fit true to size as well. Some other shorts with the elastic waist band tend to run a little small. For reference, I'm 6'1"" with a 33"" waist and go with a L in these. I wear them for spin, running, lifting, or when I want to throw on something quick and comfortable to run around. Lulu, you've got a winner here.",,,3,0

It is incredibly tight, rides up and gets stuck, and is far too compressive. The reason I preferred the old liner was the relative loose quality, whereas when lululemon used luxtreme as a liner it was unbelievable tight.
