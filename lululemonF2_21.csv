I have never had this problem with any of the other colors and I am not a super sweaty/dirty person. I have no idea where these stains came from. Another reviewer also commented about how the white picks up colors so I would suggest skipping the white unless you want to risk wasting $60.",,,1,0

However, I am not as fond of the newer style. I have many of the older style with the cut out in the back, that style was way better in fit and I am not sure why lulu has changed the style. The new version although longer which is nice, it fits a bit too loose in the body and the change to the armholes shows too much bra.

I ordered a fair number since Christmas from WMTM, and a few items arrived in a different colour from what the pictures showed.

It's not as silky soft as the solid one I already own, but this also means that it's a little more flattering on because it doesn't cling to rolls as much. I definitely prefer the 6 for the fit in the shoulders and arms, the 8 definitely looks oversized for me there, but it does mean it's a little less relaxed of a fit in the body for my shape. These are great easy tanks to throw on and wear with pretty much any shape of bottom (shorts/pants/loose/tight).

One pair is starting to almost unravel from the seams, and the other got snags on the front part of the thigh and making it unsightly. None of my luxtreme pants have ever gotten snags on the fabric so it is highly disappointing considering the price. I would love to recommend these to friends and coworkers but I'm so skeptical now.","July 27, 2018","Hey GymnastFeels,

First, I like the fit. The rise is perfect and they “hold you in”.
I buy them in my TTS (4) and they fit on the tighter side so I never need to adjust them while working out. If you don’t like your pant to be tight, I recomend sizing up. They are not as tight as the “tight stuff” but they are not as “giving” as the “fast and free”.
Second, they have mesh, which I like. It adds to the look and to the function!
I also think that the length is great for training.
My only complain is that they don’t have side pockets....
I never liked the back pocket and I’m always reaching out to the pants with the side pockets first...

Long time lulu fan here since 2002 so I've tried and own a lot. I really wanted something in this dusty dawn color and when I turned around and blinked the high waisted wunder unders sold out so I saw these and purchased them in dusty dawn and white. I'm not quite sure where the whole pilling thing is coming from other reviewers but I've never had pilling on anything lulu that was made of luxtreme. Luon well, that's another story but that is the nature of the beast of that fabric no matter what brand. Alo Yoga I'm talking to you. What may pill is the threading but not the fabric and that has happened very rarely. Pretty much only during the whole sheer rear debacle many years ago. I luckily haven't seen a problem since. With that said these appealed to me because at 5' tall I've grown to accept that leggings were never made with us short legged gals in mind. The petite people that can get away with it are size 0 and that I am not. I'm a size 6 in lululemon and everything with long sleeves and full length leggings tend to be too long. These were actually the perfect length and went straight to my ankles. No bunching. I have killer massive calves so they actually fit pretty nice. No open spaces really. I love where these fit on my waist too. High waisted and they hold my stomach in. I like the pocket in the back waist because with a little manipulating I can fit my iphone 7plus in. I like the mesh detail but truth be told I don't LOVE it. I kinda got sick of the whole mesh thing last year. Over all these are freaking amazing. I have to disagree with the negative reviews. I've worn and washed these and I'm lazy people I don't hang dry my stuff. I wash in cold inside out and low air dry in my dryer and they show no wear and tear. I was worried about ordering my true to size in these which is a 6 because the 6 in the speed crop made of the same material is a sausage tight fit. On a good note they hold all of me in on a bad note despite how tight those are I find myself constantly pulling them up. I didn't have that problem with these. Give them a try people.

They felt like they were going to be snug while getting them over my hips but I think that's just because they're high waisted and the waistband is less stretchy than other lulus.

The first pair has surprisingly lasted the longest, despite being worn the most. I bought these in heathered slate, and that pair literally started falling apart at the seams after the first wear. After one run, the seam that goes above the butt is splitting and there are holes along the back vertical seams similar to those that form where your thighs meet. I have never had Lululemon’s literally fall apart like this. The second black pair didn’t have the issue on my backside, but did split where my thighs meet. For the record, these were only used for running. I didn’t spin in them or use them for any activity where my butt touched the another surface.

They stay up on those long runs on the trails, and are stylish enough that I can pair them with a cute sweater and run errands. I am, however, disappointed with the quality. This is the second pair that I have bought and they barely last six months before the seams start to unravel. I am diligent about only washing Lulu items with Lulu items, and where the seams are starting to unravel (i.e. the outer thigh) are not in a ‘chaffing location’ that would explain why the thread is coming apart and leaving visible holes. And I don’t think correct sizing is an issue because both pairs I have bought in-store, and have had an educator help me decide on the correct size. I love all my Lululemon products, but it is definitely frustrating that I pay $100 for a pair of crops that I can’t even get a full year out of...whereas other Lulu products, or different clothing brands’ crops, that I wear equally as much, don’t seem to be an issue.","January 15, 2018","Hi hmedm,

In addition, I've noticed that they are slightly see-through since the material is so thin.

I do exercise often, but I rotate my three pairs of tights, thus attempting to minimize overuse. In addition, I always follow the appropriate washing recommendations.

Big win with this skirt: there is no seam down the middle of the shorts. I often find the seam shows through on some lulu skirts so this is a big improvement. I also find the tape at the bottom of the shorts feels smoother and less ""grabby"" in a good way.

And yes, the waist band and the entire skirt runs small, similar to two way stretch fabric in pacesetters (please bring them back!), so, i recommend sizing up.....the good news is that the silicone grips are back and they even have lululemon on them.....the combo of flare at the back and pleated fabric on the sides is adorable and the pink color is so lovely and feminine....the problem is that with lighter Colors fabric is so thin, it is see thru in undershorts and shell, too....now if you choose a pattern, then the pleated part is visually unnoticeable, taking away from sophisticated design.....now if the undershorts came in floral nulux kind fabric and the outer shell was thicker as it is used to be....it would solve the problem....",,,11,2

First the thinner headbands were made with a thinner velvet strip, which did not have the same holding power. Now in this latest version the thinner velvet strip has been put on a thicker headband. Making the headband wider while making the velvet strip thinner takes away even more from the the anti-slip grip.

However, on my thick, wavy hair the headband does have a tendency to slip. When I go running (on a treadmill), I usually have to readjust the headband every 5-8 minutes. This is a lot better for me than other headbands, which fall of my head within seconds, but this is still not ideal. I haven't worn it for running outside yet, but I assume it'd be more prone to slip out with an outdoor breeze. When I wear this for yoga, since I don't want to be distracted by a falling headband, I use a couple of bobby pins to secure it so it doesn't slip off and it lasts the entire class. Just a little inconvenient but it's a workaround! Compared to the skinny fly away tamer, this works a little bit better due to the thicker band. The skinny fly away tamer had two lines velvet though, so I wonder if this one would work even better if it had two also.",,,7,5

These headbands are good for that, however they definitely lose their shape. I still like them and wear them, but it is annoying to have to keep adjusting a headband as you're trying to work. I like the width of them because you can wear your hair down with them and you don't get that awkward bump, but they do definitely need some work.

Eventually I decided that they weren't meant for working out, so I just wear them when I'm out.

I have thick, naturally wavy hair and being honest during my workouts I sweat a lot and these do a great job of absorbing the sweat and keeping my awkward, weird little hairs tamed. Hence the clever ""fly away tamer"" title these little numbers have. But after a couple workouts I noticed these headbands don't stay as tight on my head. Like I stated earlier I have thick, wavy hair so I can't imagine how these would stay on someone who has thin hair. I love how thick the headband is, they're good, but not great.

I wear my hat for hikes with my very active Husky dog (Minimum of 5-7 walks a day at least 45mins-1hour) and the Run version works much better for sweating and heat because it is thinner and allows for more air to circulate. Where as the Baller Hat gets very hot and makes lots of sweat drip down my face. So though the Baller Run Hat is functional it has the weirdest cone head shape. I find myself constantly adjusting the strap to see if a tighter or looser fit will make the top cone shape less noticeable.

I love Lulu and will continue to purchase their head gear (hats, headbands, and scarves) but I would not recommend this hat.

So when I came back to get the black one I didn't notice that the back adjustable strap was different. Putting the hat on I had to make the strap bigger and it caused the 'tail' end of the strap to hang out. (It does not do this on the white hat). I thought it would be a small feature that I could live with since I loved running in the white hat. I was wrong. It was very uncomfortable and looked even worse. Thinking it was just a batch that was manufactured different I just purchased another one. It is a little better but the strap barely tucks into the hat. I just wish there were some more similarities as the black hat pictured above has the strap that is perfect... however not the ones I found in store.,,,3,0

If I wrap around twice, my hair will hold loosely in a high/low ponytail or bun and if I wrap 3 times, my ponytail isn't moving. Did cleans and snatches, and my high ponytail stayed in place. Did bench and back squats with a low ponytail and was able to push my hair aside without the hair tie moving along with it (giving me a side pony). Comfortable to use to keep my hair out of my face when sleeping. Made of a nice, seemingly sweat wicking material and leaves a very minimal dent that works it way out (side note, my hair does not really hold dents).
I think the best part about the scrunchie is that I can have a secure high ponytail that is not pulled very tight and also does not fall (pulling on my forehead), which is why I think the $14 is justified. If I end up buying more colors, I'll update the review as others have noted that different colors do not perform the same.",,,1,0

I bought 3 of them in one day and i was just so excited to workout in them. But, with the warmer months coming up, i knew i wouldn't be able to wear them for too long, because it would be too hot. This is exactly what i needed! I do not own one yet, but i already know that i will love it! I hope I am able to buy one soon. Thank You Lululemon, You hit it out of the park!",,,0,0

I normally wear headbands from other athleisure bands like Nordstrom's Zella but decided to try Lulu after seeing many of my classmates wear their tanks and leggings in Pure Barre. I wear my hair up in my PB class and this headband was falling off my head within the first few minutes of class. Even after the warm up, the headband would not stay on without riding back and was more of a distraction than anything. I don't know how Lulu expects people to run with this headband staying in place. I wish I could return it but I already cut off the tags and there is a no-return policy on headbands. The style is cute (2 stars for this), but save your money and don't buy this product.","September 9, 2015","Hi ChristineDC,

First of all, the fabric is great. It washes well and looks good. It's stretchy and fits to my head fairly well...but that said, whenever I have my hair pulled straight back (like into a bun or a high ponytail), it slips right off my head. I actually had to use bobby pins to get it to stay on, but for 15 dollars, I think that the headband should be able to stay on by itself. However, when I just need it to keep my hair out of my face, it does a pretty good job. Overall, I think that it is not worth the money and that the cons far outweigh the pros. For those reasons, I would not recommend this product.",,,1,0

I wore it to dinner one night with my hair up and it didn't even stay on for the first 5 minutes! I found myself taking the headband off and putting it in my sweatshirt pocket.

I work 12+ hours as a nurse so I'm always on the hunt for good headbands that stay in place. I found Lululemon's Bang Busters to be absolutely amazing for running, but I didn't want so much fabric bulk at work. A store associate recommended these headbands to me, saying that the material on the inside would grip my hair and help keep it in place. Well, after only one hour on the job, this headband was already creeping it's way up my head. By the end of my shift, it had completely stretched out and wasn't tight on my head at all. I had bought two, so I tried the other one the next day, thinking maybe I had just gotten a bad one. Unfortunately, the other one did the exact same thing. My head isn't unusually large, and based on the other negative reviews, I'd say this is a common theme with these. I'm just so disappointed that I spent nearly $30 on two completely useless headbands. Don't waste your money!","July 29, 2015","Hi NicolePR,

By 5pm it was gone, off my head. We have several acres, and I was all over most of it, so I'm sure if it's not in the house the lawnmower will find it later. It was pretty, but not grippy at ALL. I can't even tell you if it held my hair back, but I assume it didn't because when it left me, I would have felt my hair falling around differently. Since I didn't notice, I would say the headband doesn't even do it's job anyhow.
I am so sad and angry. There were cross back tanks for only $10 more at the store, and I am kicking myself for spending so much on a headband that didn't last 6 hours, when for $10 more I could have had a tank and even if I only wore it one or two times, would have been more worth it.
