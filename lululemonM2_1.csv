The Metal Vent Tech t-shirts and Polos sold me on the brand. The new version seem to be an attempt to maximize profit by reducing quality. The design seems to have been simplified by removing the back side technical pattern which gave the shirt a more high end appearance and provided better breathability for workout hot spots. They also don't seem to be holding up as well either. They seem to stretch and sag a bit more as well as pilling.

It now comes in the 4”, 6”, but w/ the OOM liners. Some may enjoy the new updated surge shorts but I am not a big fan. This just gets in the way during my bikram classes. I do not understand why you have to change things that are not broken. I may have to venture on other brands as there’s no other 4” or 5” shorts you have with the regular liners anymore. An associate suggested purchasing other shorts w/ the liners I want & just have it tailored (as that's free) so it'll be the same length. It's so much of a hassle.

The liner is too tight, too small, and too short. I am a fit yogi with 33"" waist wearing a size large in these shorts (normally wear medium), and the liner is constantly moving and creeping up where it needs to be adjusted constantly and continuously during my yoga practice. I tried wearing them a few times to practice to see if I could get used to them, but it is a losing proposition. One cannot partake in yoga with a liner that will not let you move thru your flow. The luxtreme liner is far superior, never a need to adjust during yoga, with ultimate comfort.
Other issues, the side pocket seems smaller, items do not fit comfortably like previous shorts. Also, pocket on liner is difficult to place phone into, not as secure as previous shorts.

burned and the only thing of any quality left is the customer service.
I have no idea why they decided to make these short, but they did an
absolutely terrible job. The quality is poor; the cut is terrible and
uncomfortable; the draw string is on the inside not the outside; the
waist band is ineffective and uncomfortable; etc.; etc. The fabric is
decent however, and the color is nice. That’s about it. It seems very
apparent that Lululemon is either not speaking with its customers to
find out what they want, or they are doing like Nike and catering to a
few zealous customers and freezing out the majority. Either way, I may
very well be done with them, I’m tired of returning stuff or having it

The bag is comfortable when secured, it does not bounce, and has many pockets for cell phone, papers and work clothes when making that run/commute back home from work. There is however one problem with the bag --- the bag straps, when worn with a silverscent lululemon shirt, pulls at the silverscent threads leaving a worn down patch of fabric at the upper right and left shoulder blade contact points (three of my shirts have noticeable pilling at the shoulder blade).

He usually wears them without underwear, and has not had any issues with popping out, since they are a good length. They have room to move, without being baggy, and just enough stretch in the material to allow him to get into half pigeon pose with ease. He was worried about pockets getting in the way, but the material is low profile and the pockets have turned out to be convenient. He loves how quickly they dry.

They're a great length - not too short and not too long - and they are very lightweight and comfortable. Fit true to size as well. Some other shorts with the elastic waist band tend to run a little small. For reference, I'm 6'1"" with a 33"" waist and go with a L in these.

I feel like the Linerless Pacebreakers fit a little better because I have the boxer jock underneath. I normally wear size Large in the Pacebreaker, but had to go down to medium in the Linerless.

After having to do laundry every few days to keep my gym clothes from having that funky smell that you can never get rid of I decided to try these Metal Vent Tech products and I was impressed. After a month or so I decided that it was time to look at updating all my gym shirts to products like this and eliminated basically anything cotton from my gym bag. In doing so I went to my local lululemon store and I purchased a number of Metal Vent Tech items including this 1/2 Zip and also a Metal Vent Tech hoodie. I don't really wear these items to workout in like I do the shirts and tanks. So they really shouldn't have much wear on them. Much to my surprise this garment as well as the hoodie are made of what would appear to be a lighter weight fabric than the shirts and tanks. The fact that warmer weather garments are made of a lighter weight fabric seemed a bit baffling to me. However the most troubling thing for me was that after only one wash, both of these garments did not fair well. They showed a lot of wear and had significant pilling. The pills would easily snag or get caught on things and cause small holes or tears in the fabric over time. I might understand this happening if I hadn't taken care in washing the garments. However, I had just purchased a new front loading washer and washed these two garments by themselves in cold water. I attempted to return the items without luck so they sat at the back of my closet until recently when i was going through things and found them. I decided to give them to goodwill and was reminded that I should write a review so that others are cautioned against purchasing this garment, or others that are made from the lighter weight material used here. I made the assumption that all items with the name Metal Vent Tech were made of the same fabric, but clearly they are not. While I have had a great experience with most of the shirts and tanks, this experience makes me cautious as purchasing other Metal Vent Tech products.",27-Oct-17,"Hey GregoryGearGuy,

I've always loved the fabric/feel/stretchiness of all 4 of my surge tanks and have never had a problem with them. I mainly order online for convenience, but the last time I was in the store buying additional items for my wife, I picked up another surge tank and really liked the dark maroon color of a metal vent tank so I bought it as well. This tank feels great and has all the benefits of the surge tank without the extra holes/vents.
Now my bad experience....since I liked the metal vent tank I bought in stores so much, I purchased two more when they were on sale online. I got them in a very dark green/black color and a deep cobalt blue color. Both tanks feel nothing like any of the prior tanks i purchased. The material is very rough on the skin, scratchy/itchy, and almost seems like a harder material that doesn't have as much stretch. Needless to say i'm very disappointed in the purchase of these two as they seem like a whole different tank from a cheaper quality brand. At first I just thought it was the style and lucked out by getting an extra soft one with the maroon tank I first purchased, but after going back into a store and trying on a grey and a white metal vent tank I'm convinced there's a quality assurance issue or somethings wrong with the fabric. I have to be careful pulling/stretching out the tank when it clings to me because it already seems to be pilling and the seams might come undone if i pull too hard (would never happen stretching the surge tank out or my other maroon metal vent tank).
I guess from now on i'll stick to the surge tanks because they feel amazing and haven't let me down so far.",7-Jun-18,"Hi PupFamTXCO,

These are not the same quality as before. I wear these to play basketball and weight lifting, and let me tell you, they are not great quality for those type of exercises. The tanks are supposed to wick off sweat for lightness and breathability but it acts more like a sponge. They absorb all my sweat and weighs it down after 20 minutes of exercise (fyi, I'm not a heady sweater, just normal). The sweat absorption causes you to get very cold if you don't have a spare shirt to change in. It actually caused me to get a mildly sick one time due to how much liquid was on my body and the cold temperature of the gym. Ever since, I either avoid wearing these or bring a spare shirt to change if I'm out of workout clothes (a huge inconvenience in the middle of a workout). I would definitely stay away from these and try a different brand that will do what it is meant to do. If you like to wear tanks normally without exercising in them, these are not a bad option but at this price point, it's not worth it.",,,0,0

Let me tell you the shirt STINKS before you even wear it, right out of the wash the shirt smells I couldn't even stand the smell through out my work out. It smells like some kind of copper or metal (hence the name). But I don't understand this logic, why make a shirt that is suppose to mitigate POTENTIAL stinkiness coming from sweat and bacteria by creating a product/fabric and inherently stinks to begin with. I was very upset when it made all my other clothes in the wash stink as well. I tried washing it again after the first wash with more detergent and the smell would not go away. I wouldn't recommend buy anything from the metal vent line for this reason. Lululemon shorts are second-to-none, I have dozens of their shorts but this tank is a no no.

What I don't like about this shirt is that it seems to lose its shape very quickly and it seems to run big. At first, when you put it on it seems to be an athletic cut, but not long after you start wearing it the shape is lost and it kind of becomes baggy.

This is the first review I have written about any product from LuLu and that coming from someone who who has shopped LuLu for the past 8 years and wears some kind of LuLu clothing almost everyday of my life. Recently bought this shirt in 3 different colors navy, black, and teal. Navy and black shirts fit great as always and are comfortable to wear when working out or as casual. Though old versions of this shirt seem more durable as this shirt is very thin and light...possibly prone to holes as I read from other reviews. The Teal version of this shirt however has a completely different fit then the other two colors. Very tight almost like spandex and I have never worn anything but large shirts from LuLu. Will be returning the teal but keeping the navy and black. Truly hope the quality of LuLu makes a comeback since how durable and comfortable the clothing always has been is why I don’t mind paying a premium for these clothes. As I read reviews all across the board on many of their new products it doesn’t look good right now. Make LuLu Great Again.",,,11,0

The neck line has started pilling pretty badly, and a small hole has developed in the fabric at the navel. Not sure how the hole got there, but anything is possible. The pilling though is something I would expect with a cheaper, poorer quality shirt, not necessarily one at this price point, and not after such short use.

There are also signs of wear along the ankle and arch support. I bought three pairs of these socks and have had the same issues with all of them. Disappointing for socks at this price point to wear out within a few weeks of light use.",22-Aug-17,"Hey Tdid,

I think I will refuse to wear any other type of sock for the rest of my life. Fitted to L+R feet, reinforced in the right places, and are crazy durable! Never smell like feet after a long day either!",,,0,0

Silver",,$18.00 ,,2.6 out of 5,1 out of 5,RAUCE,,,,,,,,Socks don't fit. Poor Return policy,5/18/17,"The packaging does not have sizing recommendations, so i followed the lead of the Store's associate and purchased L/XL. When i returned home (which does not have a Lulu store), i tried the socks on and realized i need a different size. I have since tried to return them online, but unfortunately Lulu's policy does not allow such a thing... so basically i am out $40 for two pairs of socks that fit worse than tube socks.",18-May-17,"Hey rauce,
Sorry to hear that the wrong size was recommended to you—that's definitely no good. We stand behind the quality of our gear and would love to know more about your experience with this. Keep your eye out, an email is on its way.",0,0

The only things that I don't like is the seams on the sides of the socks which kind of stick out. The socks could also breathe a little better. I love the design and they have been a great sock for me but there is definitely room for improvement.,,,2,0
