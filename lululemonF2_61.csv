Its a staple in my closet and I like many other avid lulu shoppers have more than their fair share of this tank. When I saw these on WMTM I like many bought several pairs. Okay, I bought 5. I've never reviewed this tank because I never really saw the need. Its a basic racer back tank that wicks away sweat and is constructed beautifully. I decided to write this review 1/2017 because I noticed a lot of reviews complaining about the fabrication. They are not wrong. There is definitely a difference in the quality and thickness of fabric. I find this much more silky to the touch which is why many are saying this is more like luxetreme. It is also lighter weight. I compared construction to my older tanks and they seem to be similar. My theory is that these are a prototype of the redesign to the newer tanks that was released. I could kind of tell by the tag. Which has an actual price on it. This is something I usually see in store or in outlet not when buying online. Which is why they had so many and immediately these went on sale. Now I don't really feel that that's a bad thing. Heck I will take the discount price any day of the week. I think what people are kind of mad at is that we thought that we would be getting the same quality as the older tanks and this is not the case. It's a sort of prototype it seems. Honestly I still like the 5 I purchased. I liked the price and I don't mind that its thinner fabric. I feel that overall they still have a solid construction.

It ended up exposing about half my bra in front and I had to tug it back up at many times. None of my other cool racerback tanks have given me this problem. This tank also feels a lot thinner than the others. Extremely disappointing. That being said, I still hope this tank isn't discontinued as the crb 2 does not appeal to me at all. I wish to continue buying this tank if lululemon at least maintains its quality in future.","August 3, 2016","Hi Emery7,

A really cheerful light, pale pink. Even checked both my tablet and desktop computer to confirm the colour, as I have felt mislead by colours in online photos before (helloooo heathered bleached coral swiftly) This arrived and it's a literal neon pink, not at all the soft, light, pink pictured online. Totally different. I hate this colour and doubt I will ever wear this. Boo.",,,2,1

Please don't discontinue!,2016-07-31,"The number of CRBs I have is embarrassing, but I can't help myself -- these are the most versatile, practical, well-fitted, timeless pieces of clothing that Lulu makes. I've taught fitness classes for 18 years and find myself gravitating to this top again and again and again, wearing two or three different ones a day. Mix it with a different bra or different pair of bottoms for tennis, yoga, spinning or tabata, and you can have a whole new look! The shape is great, the fit is flattering on EVERYONE and the price was always right. Why Lulu is looking to discontinue or ""change"" this staple is bewildering to me. Instead, I would have loved to have seen more amazing solid colors (Alberta Lake, anyone?) ... Beyond sad that this one may get pulled. The CRB II looks like a poor substitute. Please reconsider, Lulu! And if you don't own these, stock up before they are gone!",,,2,1

I love how soft it is and wear them everywhere doing just about anything (run, work, casual). I just purchased the Cape Red and it is absolutely one of the most striking colors I've ever seen. However, I was disappointed to see that I paid $34 for it final sale but then saw it on WMTM fo $29??? Why the price differences? Not a huge amount but just curious. Other than this issue, I have never been unhappy with any of my purchases!",,,2,1
